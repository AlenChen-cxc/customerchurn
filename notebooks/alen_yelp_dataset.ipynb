However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\n\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\\xc3\\xa9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\n\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.\",\n",

Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  \\nThe store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! \\nGreat clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). \\nChristian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store.

       "        b\"Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \\n\\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \\n\\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.\",\n",
       "        b\"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\",\n",
       "        b'I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn\\'t know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\\n\\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician\\'s offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!',\n",

Although the restaurant/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \\n\\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.\\n\\nThe real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!

       "        b\"I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \\n\\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \\n\\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\\n\\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.\",\n",

I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it!

No harm no foul. \\nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \\nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn\\'t have done, but I\\'m a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work. We called the front desk. \\nShortly thereafter, a housekeeper appeared with a spray bottle to investigate. She agreed that the carpet needed to be cleaned (which would happen the following day), and began spritzing, what I can only assume to be anti-mold stuff? I didn\\'t ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \\nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \\nYou\\'re probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \\nI am very much alive.

Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \\n\\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect.

Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn\\'t want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.\\'s, Emily R.\\'s and Alain L.\\'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I\\'m so used to dining out, I couldn\\'t resist, I suppose!!\\n\\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.\\'s grits side and Emily R.\\'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we\\'re Yelpers, so we\\'re gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\\n\\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin\\'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.\\'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron\\'s wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\\n\\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he\\'d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\\n\\nI have to say . . . I\\'m \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I\\'m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it\\'s a gracious gesture on management\\'s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn\\'t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn\\'t *really* care, he noted he\\'d worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you\\'re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\\n\\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary\\'s once noting how sloooow everyone\\'s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn\\'t) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn\\'t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\\n\\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .',\n",

I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred\\'s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\\n\\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line.

Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable.

However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \\n\\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\\n\\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\\n\\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\\n\\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.\",\n",

However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don\\'t expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald\\'s Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it\\'s FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant\\'s help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\\n\\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go.

So worth it!\\n\\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\\n\\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\\n\\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\\n\\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\\n\\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\\n\\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese / gorgonzola yumminess.\",\n",

       "        b'I\\'m having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they\\'re using Yelp in the right way - they\\'re using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I\\'ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I\\'ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that\\'s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren\\'t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn\\'t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\\n\\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn\\'t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There\\'s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn\\'t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren\\'t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\\n\\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I\\'m kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn\\'t pay extra, that wasn\\'t really a deal breaker for me.\\n\\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.',\n",

Gee, can you think of a more UNPLEASANT way to wake up at 7 a.m?

       "        b\"I think SideBar is the only restaurant downtown where you can have a 2 hour lunch and only spend 15 minutes of that actually eating and enjoying it.  The rest is spent waiting.  Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\\n\\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\\n\\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.\",\n",

I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \\n\\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.\",\n",

I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\\n\\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \\n\\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out.

Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.\",\n",
       "        b\"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \\nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.\",\n",

But after looking around more and\\nafter talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality (better work actually) the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn\\'t make me feel like I\\'m scum.\\nBethany dental front desk staff didn\\'t help at all with the situation. after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly $800 for a supposed root canal (it would of been more if i hadn\\'t blocked them from my bank) i actually received an email from them stating \"we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal\" I\\'m not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots. If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that, nothing else! \\nBefore doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental, don\\'t me like me and rush into it, take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they\\'ll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs.',\n",
       "        b\"This restaurant is delicious! I've had Ethiopian in DC (which is the best I've tried) but this place is a close runner up.\\n\\nThe boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We first got the honey wine which was really sweet and syrupy. It reminded me of mead. Then we got the meat combo and everything was tender, delicious and flavorful. They certainly don't skip on the injera here. \\n\\nMy favorite part about this place specifically is that they serve the food traditional style in colorful baskets! I've never seen that before and it made the experience that much better :)\",\n",

       "        b'Might be helpful if you were looking to buy, but if you need help with something you currently have then good luck getting any help or response.  I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn\\'t drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn\\'t help at all so I don\\'t know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn\\'t like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don\\'t care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.  It\\'s obvious the workers don\\'t want to be there.  Stay away from this store and Sprint',\n",
       "        b\"This Chicken Express has been doing it right for years now. I've never had a problem, the service is always top notch, and the place is always squeaky clean - dining area, exterior, bathrooms, even the kitchen appears much cleaner than other fast food place from what I can see. I love their fried chicken liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don't have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times. Even if it's just one order of 6 chicken livers, they are happy to cook them up fresh so they are ready when I arrive. Now THAT is exceptional customer service. Thanks Chicken E!\",\n",
       "        b\"Something about this place made me feel like a smart, cool, hip, 30 something as soon as I walked in the door. The ambiance is dark and inviting at the same time. The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \\n\\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \\n\\nFor the entr\\xc3\\xa9e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \\n\\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.\",\n",

       "        b\"I was in Austin recently and searched for a place to eat on this fine website called Yelp. We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\\n\\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\\n\\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\\n\\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here. I will make it a point to come back the next time I'm in town.\",\n",
       "        b\"I used to love this place.  The food is very good, and thankfully that hasn't changed.  However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \\n\\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \\n\\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it.\",\n",
       "        b\"My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving.\\n\\nThe service was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.\\n\\nI would never eat here again.\",\n",
       "        b'Will not be back!!! The service was just awful. We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it. However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!',\n",
       "        b\"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\\n\\nDecor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\\n\\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\\n\\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\\n\\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\\n\\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\\n\\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.\",\n",
       "        b\"Good may have been good if my server Megan T actually used a pad and took people's orders instead of guessing and just putting whatever she thought you wanted in front of you. Manager offered discounts because everyone else in my party ate but me, and still charged me for bad food. Stay away. Place next door (Hennessy's) had great food and specials. Thanks for charging me for food I didn't eat and trying to pacify me with discounts you never applied. Boo.....boo......on the right side theTV's are in good spots to watches you eat.....well try to eat\",\n",
       "        b'We ended up staying here for a trade show, and I shared a gigantic room with my coworker. Service is excellent in the lobby. Smiles on their faces like they really want to be there. They were dressed nicely and showed us where the restroom was and the plugs at the table in case we had to wait for someone. Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \\n\\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor\\'s bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \\n\\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \"shoot pool\" time.) The pool was also pretty nice, but when we stayed, it was pretty cold to be swimming. \\n\\nI would love to come back and hope to organize a squad trip for my Potterhead friends. It was super nice and not far from the places to see.',\n",
       "        b'Came here for a friends birthday and was impressed! The service was wonderful! Everyone is so friendly and helpful, the chef even came over and said hi. I ordered the duck, it was delicious, very flavorful! The only complaint I had was that it was just duck, no side. Although it was good it was a little weird to eat just duck for dinner.',\n",
       "        b\"I've been to this location twice and couldn't be more disappointed. I looked through my provider list and saw this dermatologist listed so I called up for an appointment. When I arrived, I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney. Not the doctor, but the physician's assistant. Huh. Ok. Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor...\\n\\nStephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. \\n\\nTook several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time). And it's not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay. I literally sat down, said nope no changes, and got a new prescription.\\n\\nTime to find a new dermatologist.\",\n",
       "        b'I ate here recently on the recommendations of some Muslim brothers at the Islamic Society of Boston (beautiful masjid). They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the chicken kabob and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch. InshaAllah my wife and I will return soon.',\n",
       "        b\"This place is only worth your time if you are looking for discount designer jeans. My advice to anyone selling anything- try eBay or even donate. If this store actually does accept your used clothes/purses (which is an obstacle in itself, unless you have the style of a 13 year old) they really don't offer a lot. I find that I get more pleasure out of donating my old clothes to a worthy cause. Also- if you do dare to try to sell something to them, give yourself an afternoon because they are highly unorganized and very slow.\",\n",

So I just go inside and the manager says they give us a voucher for the free hour. \\nThe waiter was not very attentive. He didn't check on us much. The service at the Johns Creek location is much better. However, I will say the drinks were great and very strong\",\n",

NOTHING takes priority over my aerial class, (seriously, just ask my husband). I look forward to it every single week. The instructors are fantastic, supportive, funny, positive, motivating, and excellent at explaining the various skills. I gained strength very quickly, even going just once a week, but the biggest benefit I have found is that my 75-minute class is the ONLY time in my entire week that I can honestly say my mind is 100% in the present moment. When I'm at aerial practice I don't think about anything else in my life except exactly what I'm doing. I'm concentrating, getting a workout and laughing so hard every single class. It is the best therapy out there, I swear. The groups in each class are small enough to get lots of individual attention from the instructors, so you learn something new every time, and we all support and encourage one another as we're attempting new, challenging skills. I can't say enough positive things about this place...you just HAVE to try it!\",\n",
       "        b\"This is my new spot for a good burger.\\n\\nDrew and I visited this restaurant on Friday, July 11th.  \\n\\nInitially, we went there to get a special milkshake.  They serve shakes with a little alcohol.  Yes, a little alcohol.\\n\\nThe decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  \\n\\nDrew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.\\n\\nThe Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.    I loved the bun.\\n\\nThe Java Jitters milkshake was too sweet and I really did not like the big straw.  Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.\\n\\nThe onion rings lacked seasoning. Very bland.\\n\\nThey had other menu items that is different from other burger joints like Burgers That Don't Moo, crawfish pistolettes and they have an array of signature drinks. \\n\\nOverall, I'll be back and would recommend this restaurant.\",\n",

Never heard of the place, never even been in the area before.\\nYes, the food was somewhat pricey. Everything we had was great. And for the decor, some say tacky, but this is part of what makes this place special.\\nI stepped outside with my coffee to catch a quick smoke, and when I re-entered the restaurant, there was fog, colored lights, a variety of hats came off the walls onto children's heads,and some faster faced music was pumping. Again, this is what makes this restaurant unique. \\nAll in all, I liked this place. Has some character and if I visit the area again with a craving for Italian, I will try to revisit.\",\n",

It was so loud from the children in the waiting area,  the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation  (including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. \\nThe food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don't regularly go to the OG and don't expect too much, they didn't improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills.  On all dishes there was very little sauce.  The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed (red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce.\",\n",

This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table.  We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.\\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \\n\\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\\n\\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.\",\n",
       "        b'Been here a few times.  One of the better individual hotpot places around the lower mainland. Portions are good. Price is decent considering you are cooking your own food. I always leave full. Light years better then firepot in burnaby. Definitely a try if you like hotpot',\n",
       "        b'This place is just plain great. Food is great and very unique. Service is impeccable. The Vodka cocktail is a must try if you like vodka. I ended  my dining experience with a chocolate pudding...I am in heaven. If you are in the area please do not miss this place. Cheers!!!',\n",

       "        b\"So we sat at the bar after a 45 minute wait. Excited to try what I remember to be great coffee, I ordered my food and a Lavender Mocha. We watched as they prepared our coffee. When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \\n\\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \\n\\nThere are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.\",\n",
       "        b'What a quaint little authentic Argentinan restaurant.  Located east of Downtown Austin, but close enough to downtown.  They had delicious meat and spinach empandas.  All types of Argentinan wines to choose from as well to encompass the flavors of South America.  We ordered the pork tenderloin for dinner and  the gnocchi.  I LOVED the gnocchi! I thought it was so good! For dessert we had the chocolate creme brulee.  It was delicious too!',\n",
       "        b\"Had a few delicious things here: Arroz con Camarones (Shrimp Rice), Tostones, Maduros, Bistec Merengue. Also the Queso y Salami Frito app was perfect. As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. \\n\\nA few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.\\n\\nThe drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.\",\n",
       "        b\"Wow!!! Absolutely the BEST donuts I've EVER had!!! Tried old fashion glazed, Mexican hot chocolate (favorite!!!) & apple fritters...and no kidding...BEST EVER!!! Dense, moist & DEEEEE-lightful!!! A must if you're in the area!!! Yummmmmmm!!!\",\n",
       "        b'The wireless is spotty to the point of being useless.  It was very difficult to even get this review posted, much less do a meaningful work-related task using the internet.  I do not recommend staying here if you depend on a reliable internet connection.  Staff state it is a free service so it should not matter if it works or does not work, and there will be no further effort to fix this ongoing issue.\\n\\nThe quality of the food for breakfast was slightly below that of a school cafeteria.  The waiter was surprisingly inattentive given that there was only one other table to serve (at minimum I expect a single glass of water).\\n\\nIt takes about 3-5 minutes to enter the room due to the quirky key card system; one must insert and remove the card timed perfectly or the lock faults and the process need to be retried.\\n\\nIn spite of the above, the beds were comfortable.',\n",
       "        b'We ate at this place all three mornings we were in Orlando this past weekend. The food was awesome and the servings were large! The first and third day we had breakfast there the service was so amazing! The two different ladies were very attentive and super friendly. The second day (different lady) was not as great but she was busy and alone so I will give her that. The place was very clean and a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended!',\n",
       "        b\"On a lark (which is a bird according to wikipedia and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense used in the phrase 'on a lark') we decided to try something different for dinner and went to Cafe Josie.  This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).\\n\\nThe restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.\\n\\nWe had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.\\n\\nFor dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  \\n\\nI'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.\",\n",
       "        b\"It was my very first visit  the service was awesome and they assured me that I would love the food. And guess what I definitely  love the food  hands down. It was very clean and also a nice bar you can even set outside for that summer  fun. Try them for yourself. I'll  be a regular ....\",\n",

       "        b\"Great spot. Comfortable little joint smack dab in the middle of Harvard Square. Drop in on a hot day and grab a bubble tea while shootin' the breeze with the staff. You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. \\n\\nThe only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \\n\\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. \\n\\nAlso the staff deserves a shout-out. They can talk about the Rival Mob with the best of them.\",\n",
       "        b\"I went to do my usual grocery shopping this evening got done collecting my items starting working my way to the registers, once I get close enough I notice there is only 1 register open for all items, 2 registers open for 12 items or less and 3 registers open for self service. My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it. Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register. But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with 3 at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed. I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything. At the end of the day there are several people in this world looking for work and can't find it while we have people like the ones I encountered today with positions they are clearly abusing. This place truly needs a reface of their front workers I can't say the whole store but definitely the front workers.\",\n",

       "        b\"Point #1 - Haggle Free?\\n\\nNow if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated.  I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  \\n\\nI pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. \\n\\nInstead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.\\n\\nConclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.\\n\\n\\nPoint #2 - Prices are insane??\\n\\nOnce upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\\n\\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \\nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\\n\\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \\n\\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \\n\\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\\n\\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \\n\\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...\",\n",

I am a long time lover and consumer of Tiff's Treats. This location happens to be closest to my house and my work so it is the most convenient one for me which means it's probably the only one I've been too. \\n\\nThe negatives: if you're visiting in person, the parking is abysmal. Prepare to walk from the next parking lot over, but after some fatty cookie or brownie deliciousness that may not be the worst thing. I have visited this location on many many occasions and I have never seen one employee behind the counter waiting to great customers. 99% of their business is probably delivery but every time they are in the back talking completely unaware that you have walked in and can hear them.\\n\\nThe positives: The chocolate chip, the sugar, and the snickerdoodle obviously! Outside of their very few and easily fixed negatives, Tiff's Treats cannot be beat when it comes to warm cookies on demand. They even have milk and ice cream to go with it if you so desire.\",\n",

       "        b\"Visited this restaurant today for their new weekday lunch hour and was immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff and service. However, after my Caesar salad with grilled shrimp ($8 additional) showed up, I was less than impressed. This dish comes with 4 pretty small grilled shrimp, that should really only be worth $4 at most. I even asked the waitress if that was all the shrimp it came with and she confirmed it was.

Everyone who came to our table knew and made sure to wish him a happy birthday.  We ordered the special appetizer which was a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, mussels, and some sort of white fish in a tomato sauce.  He got the skate fish and I ordered the halibut.  Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  \\n\\nThe reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the fish selection as well as the wine.  They even gave us pistachio ice cream, baklava, and homemade donuts as a birthday dessert.',\n",

       "        b\"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \\n\\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\\n\\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \\nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself.

More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I've had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry.\\n\\nIt was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry. I've never put a cupcake down before without finishing it, but for the first time I did. \\n\\nThis is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting.

       "        b\"Channing is a photo ninja.\\n\\nMy parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\\n\\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\\n\\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\\n\\nSeeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\\n\\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\\n\\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.\",\n",

       "        b\"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\\n\\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.\",\n",

       "        b'Neil England is a true \"Ink God\". I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \\n\\nLet\\'s start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \\n\\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn\\'t be done,  until Neil came along....\\n\\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \\n\\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \\n\\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \\n\\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\\n\\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances\\' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\\n\\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\\n\\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \\nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it\\'s the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....',\n",

It's a beautiful place and I can't imagine the countless hours spent putting the videos together through real flight time. That being said it is absolutely not worth the money. Unless you can't make it anywhere else in Vancouver I would skip this and visit some of the actual land, air and sea tours around Vancouver.

All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. \\n\\nWhen we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. \\n\\nWe left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights. \\n\\nThanks, team! Hopefully we'll never need to see you again, but if we get sick on the way to the airport again, we know where to go!\",\n",

Upon googling things to visit in Austin,  this spot always popped up which sparked my curiosity.\\n\\nDont expect anything fancy though when you come.  This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to.  Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history.  I was advised by the locals here that this place may no longer be here in the near future.  Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments.\\n\\nI love that there are no frills here.  If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt,  climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves.  Just do it, its worth it.  I wish i did.  But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie.\\n\\nI would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top.  Hopefully its still there at that time.',\n",

You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. \\n\\nWe had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.  I would try a different broth with a little more flavor next time.\\n\\nWe had a ton of stuff, but our favorites were the kobe beef, the scallion dumplings, the taro root, the salmon, and the absolutely delicious crab legs- we got two orders!!  \\n\\nReally you can't go wrong here- unless you are bothered by the slightly fishy smell when you first walk in.  But you get used to it!  For $20.00 this is about the best deal in China Town.\",\n",

Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be \"nail size\" or we will be charged for the repair. As a matter of fact, lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts - do nails need toggle bolts?\\n\\nThese costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before it\\'s not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand. No one like such surprises.\\n\\nThanks for offering to reimburse but not needed.

I got my cupcakes to go and I was immediately enamored with the boxes and packaging.  However when i got home and actually tried the cupcakes I was sorely disappointed.  The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  \\nI think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!  You have to have cupcakes that actually taste good... or at least are not objectionably bad!  I am not sure how they are going to make it... I hope for their sake they figure out how to actually make a product that people will enjoy eating!\",\n",
       "        b\"Visiting Atlanta for a conference and I needed a bit of respite so I searched for my favorite comfort food, pho. I was happy to find this place less than a mile from the GWCC.  I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.\",\n",

My husband and I tried this place on a whim, we are devout Salt & Straw lovers but we were in the area and were feeling adventurous. We sampled a few flavors and I immediately settled on the blood orange creamsicle, it was a little tart with all the creamy dreamy goodness you want in a creamsicle. My husband got a hot fudge sundae. The sundae was a little unorthodox, chock full of crunchy and dark cocoa nibs, but he seemed to enjoy it. \\n\\nA couple weeks later my friends were visiting and I knew one of them would just die for the blood orange creamsicle. We happened to find ourselves in the neighborhood so we stopped. 3 scoops of creamsicle later and we were all happy campers. \\n\\nPro-tip they also have a mini scoop, in case you want to indulge, but not too much!\\n\\nThe point?

       "        b'This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before. \\n\\nRegarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \\n\\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn\\'t find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \\nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \\n\\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \\n\\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \\n\\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don\\'t know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\\n\\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: \\' the situation is a lil risky for me\\'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \\n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro \\'was late\\'!  \\nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \\n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was \\'proceeding to cancel this call\\'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \\n\\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \\n\\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \\nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.',\n",
       "        b\"I went here this past weekend for their roast (first Saturday of every month). The food was wonderful.  The atmosphere was great.  Beers and cocktails were yummy!  The menu was interesting....\\n\\nBUT - the portion was small.  It was a ham roast with mashed sweet potatoes, turnips and brussel sprouts.  The meal had about a 1/4 cup of sweet mashed potatoes and 2 1/2 brussel sprouts.  I was there with 8 people and I don't think anyone left satisfied.\\n\\nI'll give it another try - but it was not a good first impression.\",\n",

I work in the restaurant scene in Boston and frequently dine at excellent places, but I keep coming back to the Wolf for my casual night out. \\n\\nQuest is MAGIC\\n\\nHowling Wolf Burrito - why do i EVER let myself get anything else??? ( because I want to try everything, that's why). It's just SO perfect. Try it. Just do it. You'll die. \\n\\nI also love the chorizo papusa appetizer. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. \\n\\nService is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times (one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower-than-desired experience. \\n\\nAfter I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends.\",\n",
       "        b\"I would definitely stay here again. \\n\\nSome of the reviews are a bit harsh.. and I'm not sure why. If you're a hotel/motel snob, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! \\n\\nThe property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \\n\\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \\n\\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)\",\n",
       "        b'I\\'ve always liked Flip (I\\'ve been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. \\n\\nThis past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1\\'s mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the \\'Haute Dog\\' made it. \\n\\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you\\'re looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\\n\\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn\\'t disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the \\'Oaxaca\\' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there\\'d be. Always a plus!\\n\\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there\\'s a muti flavor component to them as well. \\n\\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\\n\\nMy one tiny complaint/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?',\n",

And since this is one of the lower-priced nail salons in the area, I didn't come in with extremely high expectations. But even with my modest expectations, I was seriously disappointed with this place. The tools used for my pedicure and manicure looked overused and unsanitary, the women in the salon carried on a conversation at the top of their lungs the entire time I was there, and my nails were unevenly shaped. I will definitely be finding another salon in the area.\",\n",

From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can\\'t imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on.

There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn't have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I've had better. I really liked their 'bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch.

You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee (watch out for the 1/4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol).

(though the website part through Qwest has been flaky) \\n\\nThey continue to delight me with their service: \"Do you have a substitute for the plastic bags covering the newly cleaned clothes?\" (they do). \"I lost some __, do you know where I can buy some in town?\" \"We have them, how many do you need?\" All above and beyond!\\n\\nThe traffic flow in the area is tricky, suggest approaching them from Broadway and PSU.\\n\\nGood service!',\n",
       "        b\"Went there last night and was disappointed again!  How hard is it to take and order and fill it?  All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived.  At least they didn't put it on the bill this time.   I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.  And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent.  Not a good showing last night.  It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.   Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service?  That's a tough sell.\",\n",
       "        b\"Finally, a non-threatening and reasonably priced Brazilian BBQ!\\n\\nYou have two options here: all-you-can-eat for $12 and change or pay by the pound.  The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.\\n\\nNow, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.\\n\\nThe fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  \\n\\nBe sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.\\n\\nA special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.\\n\\nThere's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.\\n\\nThe value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience.  I will definitely be back.\",\n",

       "        b\"I mostly eat here at lunch, for the tremendous buffet. I don't have another benchmark for Tibetan cuisine so my raking is based on the comparison to the other lunch staple in Central Square: the ubiquitous Indian buffets. I admit to a fanatical love of cilantro and it is featured in many of the dishes.\\nThe dumplings are my fav(Tsel Momo, Langsha Momo), and I always start with those. I also like the noodle dishes(Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp(Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef(Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork(Phaksha Solo) and chicken(Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too. If you like nan try the breads.\",\n",

       "        b\"Precision Moving Company did an amazing job moving our belongings from Brookline to Cambridge last week. Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way. They cleaned everything out in record time, and were flexible when we uncovered and threw some extra stuff at them at the last minute. The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved. They obviously take pride in their work and we'll never use a different moving company again!\",\n",

Every staff member seem to know the people walking in, and remembers what colors they like, what type of shoes they prefer...etc. \\n\\nThe quality of Ferragamo is top-notch, paired with elegant design in handbags to shoes (super comfortable). The quality is certainly reflected in the price. Though I don't shop here often, I always feel like I'm in Handbag-Heaven when I walk in! \\n\\nI wish Toronto had their own Ferragamo boutique shop, instead of just the varieties available at Holts. So, this place is a must visit when visiting Vancouver!\",\n",

All were lovely, and there was quite a bit left over for two of us. I also especially appreciate the very reasonable glasses of wine to enjoy along with the food.  Ambiance is cozy, quiet.  A great date night and some tasty treats (for those not familiar with Himalayan food, there is a bit of something for everyone, curries and things that sounds like what you might find at Indian restaurants, to other things that are quiet apart). We didnt try the green papaya salad on the menu but that also sounded yummy',\n",

Had an appt with another stylist, but she was running late so I was put with JEREMY. Thank you, God! He is AMAZING and I'm thrilled to get in on the beginning of what will be his amazing career. He is an ARTIST. I brought pictures in to show him what I was going for, talked about how my thick straight hair lays flat on my head like a dead raccoon in the hot/humid summer, asked if he could please cut it (and show me how to style it) so that it doesn't do that. He did some amazing techniques (which my previous $90 stylist had never done), and my haircut is AMAZING. He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable. I feel beautiful! Am going to take a picture today to post with this review.\",\n",

Well, this I have to see.\" I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T\\nhe salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican\\'s Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. \\nI also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma\\'s food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. \\nWhen I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.

But a few things will probably keep me from going back. The server actually left out a donut I asked for and I had to check the box and make sure it was in there so that was kind of lame because she definitely charged me for it.\\n\\nThe donuts themselves are very thick and yeasty so I could only make it through one before I felt very full. I like to have a variety of donuts and different flavors when I splurge on donuts and it just isn't possible here. \\n\\nI think I'll probably stick to other places that do the donuts themselves better and aren't just a spectacle.\",\n",

       "        b'Highlights: Recently revisited BTS -- one of my favorite college hangout spots a few years back. Had an incredibly rude customer service experience. Surprised, disappointed, and won\\'t be returning. Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\\n--------------------------\\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom\\'s closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I\\'m a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I\\'m usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I\\'m not. I\\'m not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\\n\\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That\\'s fine with me.\"\\n\\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office! And despite your upward creeping prices since, I have come back at least once a year because I loved the unpretentious atmosphere.

       "        b\"I went to DryBar this past weekend to get my hair done for my 21st birthday. I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!\",\n",

Until here. 2 pages of boozy drinks but not even the hint of what their non-booze offerings were. Maybe if we'd shown up with a kid or stroller, we'd have gotten the non-alcoholic offerings. I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \\n\\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done. We had 3 mediums and a medium-well in our group. I'd have kicked the review up to a 3 if they had cooked our stuff to order. There are plenty of M&E's in town who do things more consistently.\",\n",

I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \\n\\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart.

My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists don\\'t have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver.

Maybe it was the day we ordered.\\n\\nHmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don\\'t know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn\\'t like us :O\\n\\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\\n\\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.\\n\\nBottom line:  If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I\\'d feel really bad.

The place doesn't look like much from the outside (off the main No. 3 road area of Richmond), but the inside is nicely decorated. We ordered:\\n\\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\\n\\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\\n\\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\\n\\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\\n\\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr\\xc3\\xa8me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out.\",\n",
       "        b\"My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.\",\n",
       "        b\"Enjoyed the food, just not so much the ordering style. Basically you order as if you are in a sushi joint. You check off what you'd like. But, there were quite a few options, more than I would like to see when I'm hungry. \\n\\nWith that said, the food was good, the server was very nice and helpful (albeit very quite/low voice), and I would definitely go back!\"],\n",
