It\\'s a pleasant staff, the cupcakes are pleasant, and my coffee has always been pleasantly hot and black. I don\\'t dispute those who rave about the lattes from here; I just personally avoid pussified coffee concoctions prettier than I am. \\n\\nBut the reason I come here is their particular location and neighbors: After doing the food thing at Camino Real or Asia Caf\\xc3\\xa9 or Mr. Chen\\'s, there actually isn\\'t anything more pleasant than a leisurely stroll to a \"coffee spot\" afterward - and hey, that\\'s exactly what this place is.',\n",
       "        b\"I never thought I would deal with such a horrible and dishonest realty. It was my first time dealing with brokers in Boston and I had no experience.  The mistakes they made are uncountable. They deposited my money into the landlord's account before the deal went into fruition. They didn't give me any receipt and thought photocopying cash was an acceptable receipt. They modified the address and broker fee on the brokerage disclosure form after we signed the paper. They kept pushing for the deal to happen although it was clearly a complicated situation that we needed to walk away from. They didn't give us the addendum till lease signing day and then blamed us for not taking the house because the realtor worked so hard and they kept demanding their broker fee even though we ended up without a house and even though only 2 of the 4 people signed the broker fee agreement which clearly sated that: all prospective tenants must sign prior to moving forward with the application. when I went to get my money back, they didn't give me all of it, and David, the owner, was very rude to me and treated me disrespectfully and charged me a $200 application fee though only 2 people signed the applications. I am still in the process of the dealing with the landlord to get my money back. All of this wouldn't have happened had they been professional and ethical.\",\n",
       "        b'Update: My daughter actually broke her elbow. The radiologist missed the fracture on the original x-ray but we saw the pediatric orthopedist today and she got a cast up to her armpit. Of course, the specialist doesn\\'t take our insurance so I\\'m out of pocket. While there, I got a call from Catch Air. They said that they encourage adults to play with their children on the equipment, a total contraindication from their website. And they suggested that I wasn\\'t watching my daughter closely enough--as if I could prevent an adult from rolling on top of her. They hadn\\'t yet reviewed the video footage, but I was also accused of \"grabbing her arm after she fell.\" Lovely. \\n\\nWent here twice. Knew I shouldn\\'t have gone back after the first time. First time, my friend\\'s 3 yo got stuck in a bathroom for over 30 min screaming. We couldn\\'t find him or see him because they turn the lights out all the time and it was so loud we couldn\\'t hear him screaming. Then today, we went for a birthday party. My 5 yo was climbing up this blow-up volcano thing when a grown adult lost her grip and fell down about 20 feet and landed on my daughter\\'s arm, dislocating her elbow and necessitating an ER visit after she cried 2 hours non-stop despite ice and Motrin. When we went to leave (1 parent with 4 kids 5, 4, 2 and 18 mo), rather than help me put shoes on, staff was only concerned about getting all my information for their incident report and liability. I pointed out another adult climbing on the same 20 foot tall mountain and they told me it was allowed! How is that at all safe? I have never had a bad experience at similar places around town, but the design of this particular one is terrible and so is the staff.',\n",

The price is decent for the amount you get. Seating is hard to get so a waiting game. I had the lobster roll, shared lobster mac and cheese with boyfriend and he had the 1.5 lobster. That lobster roll needed more spices but god that amount and size was perfect and fresh as the water it jumped out of. (In my experience you know its a perfect lobster roll when there is no lettuce. Legit I've had some where its more of a salad sandwich then seafood). Mac and cheese is a must, good size bites and creamy cheese. My mom was with us and had lobster bisque, no lobster meat to speak of and more watery than creamy. Lol my boyfriend did struggle opening the lobster but enjoyed the lobster...mostly for selfies. Great spot for lunch though! Not too filling but enough to keep on sightseeing and enjoying the best of boston\",\n",

Also squeezed a bit of lemon on top for that citrus flavor. (Bartenders recommendation)\\nAlso ordered the buffalo fried pickles and roasted brussle sprouts. \\nThese buffalo fried pickles are definitely on my top 3! The breading was great and this was my first time having fried pickles tossed in buffalo sauce. Soo good!\\nThe Brussels sprouts were fried and also tossed in a sauce (not sure what sauce) but was very tasty! Topped with peanuts. \\nWill have to return to Second bar + kitchen again to come try more of the menu.',\n",

I really like how they toast the buns. The burger is wrapped like a present. \\nThe seating area is clean and bright. Little bit of music in the background. Nice place to bring the family for a burger.',\n",
       "        b'My mom and I went in to use a groupon that had expired a couple of months ago but still had the original value on it of $12 that I could purchase food with. This was my second time there.  The first time I went on a regular Monday (NOT a holiday) to use the groupon and they were closed for some unknown reason.  I told the man at the counter and instead of being understanding about the inconvenience he was extremely rude. He said \"You had a year to use this!\"  My mother and I were extremely shocked at his behavior and were horrified at the terrible customer service.\\n\\nWhen we looked in the case my mother noticed a fly trying to eat the red velvet cake.  We were horrified again and didn\\'t know if we should leave or not.  However, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought we would try their cakes anyways.  We did not get the red velvet. We got a carrot cake slice, Boston creme cupcake, peanut butter cupcake and chocolate mousse cake slice.  In the process the man, who I believe was the owner, huffed and puffed the whole time we asked him for service, such as to put the cakes in two separates boxes because two were for me and two were for my mom.  \\n\\nThe chocolate mousse cake tasted like cardboard.  It was so dry that I couldn\\'t even finish it.  It was stale and old.   I did not try the carrot cake or the Boston creme cupcake but my parents said they were yummy.  I haven\\'t tried the peanut butter cupcake yet but I do not have high expectations.',\n",
       "        b\"Update: After leaving the below review, the owner of BarkZone contacted me and was professional and polite. We received a full refund and the owner encouraged us to return and visit a different groomer on his staff, but made it very clear he understood he would have to earn our business back. I give his customer service skills a 10 and updated the stars on this review to reflect his prompt attention and professional manner. \\n\\nI've never left a review before but this place was so terrible I don't want other pet owners to have a bad experience. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I brought his 5-year old Goldendoodle here for a haircut. The dog was overdue and we knew he'd have to be shaved pretty close to the skin. The woman who helped us was pretty short with us, and didn't seem interested in providing any type of customer experience. We asked for the dog's head to be kept as long as possible. The woman grabbed at his head and said she didn't have time to comb through all the matting. I know Goldendoodle fur/hair mats, and we explained we just wanted it kept as long as possible. \\n\\nWhen we retrieved our dog, he seemed happy (all other groomers he's been to comment on how well-behaved he is). A few hours later, we noticed he seemed a little quiet, and the bridge of his snout was red. Upon closer inspection, his nose was cut. Further inspection led to us discovering more cuts behind his hears, next to his nose, and on his back. These were not just nicks, but shaving all the way to skin, in multiple places. He was clearly depressed/subdued because of this and we feel terrible. \\n\\nThe groomer didn't even have the respect for us or the dog to give us a heads up about this. So unprofessional. We will not be supporting this business anymore and don't want other pet owners to experience what we did.\",\n",

       "        b\"Completely overrated.  Clearly, being on TV does not mean you're good.  We went here in late March 2014.  Our supposedly 20 minute wait for a table for two turned out to be 1 hour and 15 minutes. Granted, if they didn't cook 'medium' burger requests until they are completely blackened, they would be a lot faster. The burgers were big, but completely over-cooked, dry, charred & hardened (ordered medium, but got very, very well done).  I had the Ranch/Bacon Burger & my husband had the little brother to the Thurmanator.  The toppings on both were just ok and had no chance to overcome the tough-as-leather burgers.  The fries were nothing special either.  Though they're big, the price is way too high for the quality and wait that we experienced.  Not worth it.  Find another place for a decent burger.\",\n",
       "        b\"Drove in from Cincinnati just to eat at Thurman. Got a Johnny burger and a Draft beer. I asked to have the burger pink all the way through. 20 minutes later the burger showed up well done on a cold bun. The cheese wasn't melted. The fries are a large cut from fresh potatoes. The ones I got were undercooked, limp and greasy. The burger and two beers cost me $26 before tip. What a waste.\",\n",

Staff was super welcoming and friendly and they are also very clearly following guidelines to keep customers and staff safe during COVID times. Will definitely be back!',\n",

       "        b'Tucked in a corner of Harvard Square, this well-appointed and bright space is easy to miss when walking by. Unlike the unpretentious Crema Cafe, which previously occupied the space, this cafe reads as a bit more pretentious and certainly pricier than most cafes in the square. \\nTo sit, one must wait for a host. The servers are perfectly charming but, unlike any other cafes in the area, these servers are there to...well, serve you, which means that this place is not the best to read or work in--someone is apt to always be \"of service\" and helping/bothering you. Additionally, the cost is something of a turn-off. Perusing the menu, I find most of the dishes pricier and slightly smaller than what one might find at Tatte or Flour nearby. I am a pot-of-tea-and-a-pastry-in-the-afternoon sort of guy and am less than satisfied with the $3.75 pot of tea price tag (which comes in a pot that is literally the size of one normal cup), when one gets a $4 pot of tea at Tatte, which serves 3.5 cups of tea. \\nThis is certainly an Instagramable cafe with a healthy-looking menu but may be just a touch too much and too little for me to make it a part of my Harvard Square cafe rotation.',\n",

The plumber showed up 5 1/2 hours late (at 1:30pm), did maybe an hour\\'s worth of work, left before 4 o\\'clock with practically nothing done, our kitchen in shambles, and did not tell us when he would be back to finish the job. We were told to \"call his boss.\" After (repeated) unanswered calls and texts to Kate, we finally got another appointment for today. The plumber once again showed up, did *maybe* an hour worth of work, and left AGAIN without finishing the job. I don\\'t know what kind of business you are running, but we will never recommend you to anyone in the area. There is no excuse for leaving a job unfinished not once, but twice, with no promise of coming back to finish it. The absolute worst service I have ever experienced.',\n",
       "        b'I really wanted this to be my new favorite ramen given its sheer affordability, but alas...it falls somewhere closer to third as far as spicy ramens go (it\\'s the only kind of ramen I ever get) after the tonkotsu red from Marukin (specifically the SE location) and the vegan tantanmen from Afuri.\\n\\nThe broth was good (I got a spice level 2 after the guy working said \"no you don\\'t want 3 it\\'s too spicy) but it was sort of light and lacking some of the rich umami depth I get from the Marukin and Afuri broths. The added spice didn\\'t really add more flavor, just a very light burn. The chashu pork was a little tough (the Marukin one literally melts in your mouth) and under-seasoned for my taste. Cabbage and bean sprouts mostly just add crunch. I added corn and egg to mine (because what is ramen without the soft boiled egg?) and the egg was super creamy and delicious. \\n\\nAfter reading all these rave reviews I was just a little underwhelmed. I missed the toppings I get (for no extra $) at Marukin: the menma (aka super flavorful bamboo shoots), mushrooms, spinach, and leeks. All in all, I paid about $12 including tip. For only $3 more (including 20% tip) I can get my favorite red ramen and a physical restaurant to sit in. I\\'d give 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed half stars, but I\\'m settling on Yelp\\'s 3-star description of \"A-OK\" for this one.',\n",

Lots of parking because it's in the same plaza as kam man.\",\n",

There's usually short wait during peak hours but moves quite quickly. My favourites are the snack combo with steamed rice roll, fish Siu Mai & fish balls ( so yummy & better value than nightmarket) ! I also like their tofu desserts with taro balls, mango sago, & black glutinous dessert! Portions are generous and it's not overly sweet. Also go the mahjong set with the edible , it was cool to take photos but dessert itself was just ok. Would only get it once but I will definitely be coming back over and over again !\",\n",

Contray to what some reviews suggest and the fact this Patisserie comes up as a coffeeshop in Yelp searches, it's only a baked goods shop, really. While they do sell very normal plain jane coffee, there is no interior seating and the idea is mostly to buy stuff to go. The staff told me also they sell a lot of their baked goods wholesale to several local coffeeshops, so you can get them at Compass Coffee and a few other places I believe. \\n\\nI got an almond tart and a pear tart and both were simply delicious. I am pretty familiar with French pastries and these no doubt are authentic and while not a huge selection, an ample one. Highly recommended.\",\n",
       "        b\"This was a totally gorgeous and surreal experience. I think you'll need a couple hours to really see and enjoy it all (plus they sell wine here, so even more of a reason to stick around). I would start by taking the fork in the road to the LEFT, and checking out the water towers, the indoor lights and bottle installation over the fountain. (Those aren't the official names, but I don't know how else to refer to them!) The water towers have a beautiful view of downtown Atlanta behind them, plus the lily pads and frogs really set the mood. Indoors, it's fun to wander through what feels like a jungle and hear animal sounds amidst glowing lights. The bottles are just super pretty. Then, once you've seen this area, head back down to the fork to the RIGHT, and spend time wandering over the bridge and through the gardens. You'll feel like you've fallen into the movie Avatar, and it's super peaceful to just watch the lights serenely flicker and change color. This would be an amazing spot to take a date, so get your romance on!\",\n",

I got the rice combo, there was chicken, shrimp, beef AND pork, all meats were on kabobs so that made eating at my desk a little less sad. The rice was cooked perfectly, the menu is vague so watch out if you have ALLERGIES! My dish said nothing about being covered in peanuts, which I enjoyed but if you didn't know they did that then it wouldn't be a good surprise. The portions are yuge, like share something or you will really have to commit to wearing stretchy pants for the rest of the week. The place is cute, but so crowded that you have to lower your expectations of any personal space. The music was VERY loud, which is weird for daytime but maybe that is their thing.\",\n",

       "        b\"I heard about this shop from my brother and sister a few years ago and how much they liked their work. Before that I used to bring my vehicles for the past few decades to my uncle who lived nearby in Reading. He was one of the most knowledgeable mechanics you could ever meet. Not to mention being reliable, fair, and honest. He was known far and wide for his reputation.  After he retired I started bringing my truck to Kenny's for repairs. I have to say, I never met anyone else besides these two guys that could compare to my now late uncle as far as their workmanship. They tell you what your vehicle's diagnosis is, and what you need done. Period. No pushy add-ons that you don't need, no inflated repair bills because of this or that. After the work is all done they call you up and tell you over the phone exactly how much it's going to cost right down to the penny.  If there's another issue concerning your vehicle they might find, they'll let you know and what your options are, there's no pressuring you like some other chain repair establishments I won't get into. \\nI couldn't believe how fast they got around to fixing my vehicle, and how decent a price for parts and labor they charged me. These guys will treat you right, they don't talk down to you, and they won't give you the runaround. When you find a great mechanic as they say, stick with them.\",\n",

       "        b'Update..\\nCalled Corporate (12/28/2017) and calling BBB! Waiting to hear back from them. Also as a side note.. If you Google to get their corporate number, it has changed. The number listed on Google will take you to a company that offers trips to the Bahamas. I called a Mr. Transmissions near me and asked for their corporate number. The man I talked to was very sweet and helpful. He first asked me if I was one of his customers. LOL I told him, \"No Sir\" but told him about the experience My daughter had at the Marietta location. He told me that he had heard some not so glowing things about them. He told me to always read the Yelp reviews BEFORE going to get serviced. The corporate number he gave me is 1-888-227-8468.  My daughter has had her car back from Mr. Transmission for a little over 2 weeks now. This was her 2nd trip there in a year!! (I know...Shame on us) Well....her car is having transmission troubles again!!! So much for taking the family to Ohio to visit their other grandparents for Christmas. As my earlier Yelp review stated, my daughter has a special needs daughter and CAN NOT risk breaking down on the side of the road somewhere!! She also has 2 boys under the age of 14 and does not need to be stranded on the road. Period!! I am livid!! She is called to her daughters school (a lot) when her daughter has a cluster of seizures and if she is unable to pick her up, the school then will call a ambulance to transport my granddaughter and the teachers aide has to go with her until my daughter can get to the hospital. My granddaughter is non-verbal and has to have 24 hour care. I am not trying to be petty. My daughter has now taken her car to this location twice and paid close to $8,000 in total for NOTHING!!  Just wanted to put this Update on here in hopes that I can spare someone some heartache and money. Please stay clear of this location. Not saying that all the locations are like this. But I know this location will rip you off! Can\\'t help but feel that they took advantage of my daughter and her family.

We intended to get the brunch box for two, but we were told they didn't have the twice baked hasbrowns, and wasn't given an alternative or a discounted price.

I stood there wondering why we didn't get the same offer or a discount. When we finally got our food and sat down to eat it in the comfort of our own home, the quality of the food was disappointing, it was smashed and sloppily put together. \\n\\n I am over all disappointed in the service, quality of food, prices, and atmosphere we experienced.

Now on to the...\\n\\nFood: My girlfriend ordered the dolsot bibimbap which was mediocre. The stone bowl was dirty and had an unnatural yellowish hue. It did not look appetizing. I ordered the Kalbi Lunch Box, which had an assortment of foods. One of them was what-seemed-to-be mini Italian meatballs in watery marinara sauce. I did not know what to make of it in a Korean restaurant. The kalbi itself was alright; it tasted fine but a little cold.\\n\\nService: It might be their first time opening a restaurant or business but our waitress did not seem to know what she was doing. There were only a few tables at the time we went but she was constantly in a frenzy. She looked anxious and non-attentive for most of the time. It took over 5 minutes to get the attention of our waitress for the bill even though she was less than 7 feet away. Also, when we first came in, we were seated by the entrance because the other ones were filled. We kindly asked the waitress to please close the front door when it was windy and in the 50s outside. It was freezing no doubt. She obliged but within 10 minutes, a different server came and opened the door even wider this time! As we were almost finishing our meal, we didn't bother to ask them to close the door again, since it will probably be our last time walking through them anyways. \\n\\nI am glad there is a new flavor in town but unless their food and especially their service improve, I would happily drive a few extra minutes to Brighton for a much higher quality Korean meal.\",\n",

Pretty much all of their main sours were on tap or available in bottles. Their pale ales and stouts, though not bottled, were actually very good. Service was quick and friendly. You do get your samples two at a time in teeny tiny stemmed shot glasses. You have to really struggle to get a good sense of the beer with that small of a pour. Some really crazy beers on tap like a sour pumpkin ale, blonde coffee stout, ginger lime sour. Quality is high and get ready for some very avant-garde stuff.

Sure I may be biased towards the beers a bit, and especially the rotating sour choices, but almost everything about the Lodge is top-notch. Huge, high quality front projection TV in the kitchen/bar area, beautifully decorated seating spots with one next to a big fireplace, and two stories of areas to relax, enjoy some fantastic brews, and killer grub. Make your choice. \\n\\nBurger selection is great, and the beef tastes fantastic. There is a Buffalo burger on the menu for ~$13, Bleu Cheese Mushroom, and Bacon Avocado, to name a few. Regular or ale-battered fries can add to the caloric uptake, if so inclined. Other items have looked good as well. There full menu is on the web, check it out.\\n\\nThe sour Beer selections rotate on a regular basis, and they offer what is referred to as the \"Pucker Paddle\" - a taster of their four sours on tap for $8. Their non-sour beers are also tasty, like the Cascade IPA and the Razberry Wheat. Grenade growlers are $4, and 64oz. growlers are $6. A huge selection of their 750ml. bottles are on sale as well, from $20 on up. Some of their growler fills can get pricey, all depending on your palate and budget ($15 to $50). Figaro, Kriek, Honey Ginger Lime and Blueberry sours were on tap yesterday (11-19-2014). Their Portland Ale and Cascade IPA are available at Happy Hour discounts.\\n\\nThe second floor space is where you need to be for food and drink, but if time allows sneak a peak at the heart of the beer making apparatus on the ground floor. Their prices for their sours might seem high, but factor in the time necessary for these special offerings to come of age (more than 24 months on oak in some cases) and you might begin to understand why the slightly higher price. Barrels are stacked high, patiently waiting to disgorge their contents into receptive glassware of all types. If you are a fan of bacterium beers, this is a must experience. Want to pursue even more sourness from Cascade? The Cascade Barrel House is damn-near sour Mecca. Much success on your pilgrimage.',\n",

These are the BEST GOURMET DONUTS IN ATLANTA IMO!\\n\\nWhy? Their soft dough and amazing flavors! I am not a big fan of cake donuts, and BG's are the perfect texture and consistency for me. You can't go wrong with any of their amazing flavors, but my favorite is a tie between salted caramel balsamic and cotton candy. Those are my two favorite flavors of all time and they are done right. I love the slight stickiness of the caramel.\\n\\nTheir gourmet doughnuts are $2.50 each or $27/dozen. Classic doughnuts (vanilla and chocolate glaze) are $1.75 each or $18.90/dozen. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is well worth it! Their popular flavors sell out quickly. Once, I went on National Donut Day just after noon, and the staff told me they sold out of donuts twice! How that's possible I do not know... When I arrived, they only had vanilla and chocolate glaze left. \\n\\nIn addition to donuts, they also serve coffee, juice, and BACON. Thick cut bacon. Natural wood smoked, candied, candied cayenne, and chocolate dipped... All my food groups in one place.\\n\\nThey offer seasonal flavors for their coffee as well as Bon Glaze Favorites: caramel machiatto, salted caramel mocha, campfire mocha, and french vanilla. I have only tried the  caramel machiatto. It was good. Coffee is $2.95 for small, $3.70 for medium, and $4.20 for large. They also make donut towers for special occasions. In fact, I have inquired about their donut towers and requested a quote for my wedding. They were very responsive and the pricing is reasonable. \\n\\nThis store is located in the Brookleigh Market in Brookhaven. Plenty of parking available, but is shared by other businesses. The shop is small and offers limited seating. However, they have a drive-thru so no need to get out of your vehicle. Service is always fast and friendly.\",\n",
       "        b'Amazing store that caters to women and couples! Most adult stores I\\'ve been too are creepy dungeons where single men undress you with their eyes while \"browsing\" the endless supply of awkward fetish porn. This store has almost zero porn--well besides actually USEFUL options--like sex and romance videos for couples, instruction videos for pleasing women, things like that. I\\'ve always thought men needed a \\'Cosmopolitan\\' magazine of sorts that focuses on women and these are the closest options I\\'ve seen. \\n\\nAffordable outfits and fun gifts and party ideas. Girls shouldn\\'t be shy towards a store like this. It\\'s quite fun. As many people who visit I came in looking for a specific item and was driven here by their mailing coupon for 40% off under $80 and 20% off over $80. Little did I know how expensive quality would be! The sales woman was extremely helpful--as they should be when you can\\'t do returns--answering all my questions and finding exactly what I wanted. However I wasn\\'t sure if I was willing to spend 125$ before the coupon on one item. I ended up settling on something from a great brand but less expensive. Although it wasn\\'t exactly what I had wanted or expected unfortunately. \\n\\nMaybe go on the weekend because on a Friday afternoon there was only one worker and a few groups of customers. I didn\\'t want to be a bother asking for more help when there were more people there.',\n",

       "        b\"This review is for the take out order I had last night. We had a group of 4 families each call in separate orders and I went to go pick them all up so we could relax on a friends back deck. Nai Thai has absolutely nailed their COVID-19 take out procedure. Effortless, everything was clearly labeled, and all employees and patrons were sporting protective gear. \\nThe takeout was delicious. My favorite chicken coconut soup was perfect, as was the red curry I ordered. Normally I'm a maximum spicy kind of person but today's meal was for a long relaxing evening so I ordered the normal menu prep and it was delicious. The egg roll shaped crab Rangoon wasn't my thing (mostly because I didn't know what I was about to eat and was expecting a spring roll. I blame the unintentional bait-and-switch on my wife).\",\n",

If I only visit a few times a year - when I am drawn back it's usually to have a favorite dish...Their Won Ton noodle soup with roasted pork is crave worthy!  Especially as the weather starts to turn cooler.  \\n\\nHere's how the dish is put together: deeply flavored broth in which you can taste the bones, spices, herbs and vegetables used to make it.  Base noodle is a thin egg noodle sort of like a ramen, but with a firmer texture (almost al dente), then six plump pork Won Tons - their noodle wrap is cooked to a much softer contrasting texture, then awesome fresh bock choy crisp and yielding at the same time the slight bitterness of the greens begins to flavor the broth as well.  Lastly, the coup de grace - the ROASTED PORK!  The pork skin is roasted and crisped so well that it still maintains its crackly texture even after sitting in the broth for 20 minutes while you are eating it.  The pork meat and fat attached to the skin is full of flavor and not over cooked at all!  \\n\\nYes, it's one of my  favorite dishes here in Portland.  Try it and see if you agree!\",\n",

So I decided to wait thinking that the salad would be coming out any minute was I wrong, 25 mins rolled by and nothing, couldn't find our server no one to be found. So I asked someone if they could find out what's going on with the order and was told that there was a backup of orders and that was it, another 7 mins goes by and by magic the salad arrived and it seriously was iceberg lettuce sliced tomatoes and sliced cucumbers that was it that's what I waited over 40 minutes for. after finding our server and explaining my discontent for service magically five minutes after speaking to her our last item that we ordered showed up at the table now this is all been a total of over 55 minutes spent I politely informed our server that we would not be paying for the salad and the last roll  that had arrived. After digging through reviews on google , Facebook and other places it looks like this place has no idea how to utilize customer service and or communicate efficiently with the sushi chef's and the customers as this is their M.O all their bad reviews all state the same problem that service is slow or they lose their order.\",\n",
       "        b'Our first night in town before the big Yelp Open Event, Kevin insists that we (Melody L and I) try this \"amazing new restaurant.\" He gives us the story behind the owners, architect (see his Yelp below) and that got me excited. However, new restaurants seem to have their kinks the first few weeks--or sometimes months--so I was prepared just in case... but to my surprise, the night couldn\\'t have been orchestrated any better. The food, wine, service, atmosphere and ambiance ... EVERYTHING ... was, well, perfect. \\n\\nAs we waited for our fourth person to arrive, the friendly (and handsome) bartender started us with few glasses of Sangiovese, which I highly recommend. It was a tough choice deciding on apps because I wanted it all, but we opted for the cheese plate (though Kevin doesn\\'t do cheese. But the three ladies trumped the poor fella. Sorry, dude.) and Prosciutto pear salad. Another great pick. \\n\\nJust like the apps, all of the entrees were tough to choose from, but in the end, I got a peppered beef cut with truffled mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms (with what I believe were also served with rose petals). \"Oh My Gah\" was my first thought as my first bite of incredibly tender meat melted in my mouth. I probably would have licked my plate clean had I not been in public. \\n\\nThe owners/restaurant manager couldn\\'t have handpicked a better staff. All of the food was prepared and presented beautifully, the staff was very knowledgeable of the menu ... Like I said, I was really shocked to think that the place hasn\\'t even been open for two weeks.\\n\\nAnd just when I sat back and reflected on the night, a Willie Nelson song began playing in the background. Wow. I actually had a moment. The dinner couldn\\'t have ended any better.',\n",
       "        b\"We showed up at 10:10, and were told that they didn't want us to eat there because they were understaffed. When we said they were supposed to be open until 11, we were told to f*** off and they locked the door behind us.\",\n",
       "        b\"We stopped by on our way home, after a four hour drive from NYC. Since we had eaten a late lunch but had not yet grabbed dinner, I was starting to get pretty hungry, so we managed to find this place on Yelp... It's open til 1 A.M. I didn't know what to try, either the green curry or the pad Thai, but finally went with my usual... The green curry chicken. I ordered it medium hot, thinking I didn't want the food too spicy before going to sleep, and thank goodness I did!!! It actually tasted more like HOT (and I'm generally a spice fan). The portion was large for $10, and the veggies were nice and fresh. There was plenty of sliced chicken as well. Again, my only real complaint was that the curry was so darn HOT, it made my eyes tear while attempting to eat it. I will definitely go back, and hope that next time, the spice levels match what we ask for. Also, even though we did take-out, the restaurant is clean, nice looking and has a few tables for those wishing to dine in... the meals come out fast, and the employees seemed friendly. It's a good spot to keep in mind when you're craving good, solid food at an affordable price. ENJOY!.\",\n",

       "        b'I had never actually been to this Finale before when I decided to have my Bridal Shower here. I liked the idea of having my shower in a place close to the T, sometime after 2pm, and to make it a dessert party.\\n\\nSince my mom, Aunt and Grandmother couldn\\'t attend but wanted to throw me a special shower --  it was important for me to find a place that could host 25 ladies for a reasonable sum. I found out Finale charged $8.50 per person for a dessert party. Liquor was not included so I bought a champagne toast ($4 extra per person), and about 10 bottles of wine for the ladies (at about $20-30 a piece). The bill came out to around $700 (with included 20% gratuity) -- so roughly $35 a person. But, if you only bought a round of drinks and didn\\'t go wild like I did, you\\'d probably could skate away with it for around $500 total. \\n\\nThe event went really well. Emily, our server, was really attentive, I had a personalized menu, and the space was small and comfortable (though it really can\\'t fit more than 25 people) She was available when I asked her to be available, I was starving so I ordered a sandwich through her when I arrived and she was fully aware of what I had arranged with the manager.\\n\\nOne problem I found while planning it (since my mom/grandmother/aunt couldn\\'t come in) was that the Manager wasn\\'t very attentive to his email or voicemail with my questions, but honestly, it did go off without a hitch, so I can\\'t complain too greatly. However, if your\\'e a nervous nelly and need to talk to the events person a lot, this could be problematic. \\n\\nHonestly for the most part, it was such a low key planning experience. I invited the ladies, signed a contract and got my \"count\" in a week in advance. I would totally recommend this space/experience for Bridal Showers, Baby Showers and other small day-time affairs. \\n\\nThough the event was technically from 2pm-4pm, Finale let us stay until around 5:30pm in the space -- drinking the alcohol not consumed. They had a nice little gift table set up and even let us set up an hour (And hang out) before hand. I thought that was really a nice touch, it also gave me the chance to take a look at the wine menu and order a few bottles of wine within my price point. \\n\\nI\\'d totally recommend this space to any one trying to have a Sunday Bridal Shower that is a little different, stress free and full-service. It\\'s really hard to find an affordable place in Boston that\\'s a little unique and if you\\'re like me and don\\'t want to be hosting 25 ladies in an air condition-less apartment, Finale might be for you, too!',\n",
       "        b'\"It was Dog crap and I\\'m never coming back here\"\\n\\nThat\\'s what I said the the check out girl when she asked me how my food was. \\n\\nI got the fried chicken special, with corn muffins, fries, and a salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  \\nI got up to find napkins as there wasn\\'t any napkins or silverware provided, and the salad came last for some reason... maybe it was forgotten until I asked about it.  \\n\\n I guess it wouldn\\'t have been too bad if the food wasn\\'t so poor. \\nThe fries were inedible even with ketchup ~ yet another thing not provided until you complain. \\nThe corn bread was very dry, the butter very cold. \\nThe salad was small, though the dressing was good. It was a strange yellow color, but they do give you enough for 12 tiny salads. \\nLastly the chicken... it wasn\\'t terrible. Slimey which was made worse by not having any napkins. I feel the 2 they got me after I complained was a joke. Was I supposed to use my shirt? \\nIt was 4 different chicken pieces, so the large breast seemed undercooked, the small wing over cooked.\\n\\nThe best thing there was the water, I don\\'t think you get refills as I finished my water right away and even while giving me food, then salad, silverware with 2 napkins, and then lastly ketchup they looked at my empty glass and walked away. \\n\\nI only went here because my boss gave me a gift card last year at a xmas party. I think it was a blessing I waited so long to go, my coworkers told me not to and now I understand.  This place was horrible\\n\\nAlso checking out you don\\'t pay there, you have to walk to the gift shop. What a joke.\\n\\nDon\\'t go here',\n",

       "        b'I ate here the other day with my family, and it\\'s been a while since we have had service this bad. The waitress, a light skin girl with a blonde ponytail, clearly hates her job.  She was ridiculously rude to the point where my 5 year old even noticed. We are seated to a dirty table. \\n\\nThis took me by surprise as every other restaurant is over the top right now with their cleanliness (covid-19). But I\\'m honestly not too worried about catching the virus. The table had crumbs all over it, and Lotte bits of food. So clearly, the table wasn\\'t cleaned. No big deal right? Who cares, I thought. I\\'ll just ask the waitress to clean it. \\n\\nShe comes to take our drink order. I literally see her look at how messy the table is. She made eye contact with the leftover food! Lol! She didn\\'t say anything. I politely ask her if she could clean off the table. She sighs and comes back with a rag. Knocks the crumbs all over everyone. Instead of pulling it off the end of the table, she just knocks it all over our laps and says \"ok is that good?\" But doesn\\'t even wait for a response as she leaves the table. \\n\\nShe clearly missed 30% of the table on purpose. That\\'s when my 5 year old giggles and says \"she didn\\'t even clean all of it. Throughout our dinner, she continues to act like we are bothering her. My wife ordered a fajita quesadilla. She got a regular quesadilla. She told her that was not what she ordered. The girl didn\\'t say sorry, didn\\'t say anything at all. She just picks it up and walks away. \\n\\nOur bill came and I still tipped her. Not nearly as much as I would have if she would have not been terrible. Overall, I doubt we ever come back. The food was not what I typically would order. When it came, I thought it looked bland. But the flavors actually mixed pretty well. The ingredients seemed fresh. I\\'m pretty annoyed at the fact that people like that can stay employed, and I know with my luck, we would probably get her again. \\n\\nThere is NO excuse for that type of behavior. I don\\'t care if you \"had a bad day\" that day. You don\\'t take it out on customers. At some point you have to grow up and face the real world. If you continue that behavior, you won\\'t get far in life.',\n",

Kids liked everything. They do have a soy free menu and close at 3 pm each day.',\n",
       "        b\"I'd have to give Blue Fuji a 3.5 but I'll round up to 4.  The food is pretty good (best quality and taste in the area thus far for Chinese).  However, I'm not sure the organic meat is worth 3x what I'd pay at a regular Chinese restaurant.  Takeout for two can run nearly $50 dollars once you add rice and everything else which is on the high end of what I want to pay when bringing food home.  They are pretty good with packaging the food and the portions are relatively generous.\\n\\nThe front desk staff is exceptionally pleasant.  Be sure to ask for chopsticks if you want them.  It's viewed more as an exception, not the rule.\",\n",

       "        b'We cannot get enough of this place. It\\'s great to eat there in person and try new menu items, but it\\'s especially satisfying to get catering from Com. \\n\\nFor birthday celebrations at the house over the years, we\\'ve ordered a few orders of the \"large grill selection\" with beef and shrimp to feed the hungry crowd. Everyone always raves about it - so perfect and delicious and not your typical taco bar or plate of sandwiches. We also get a bunch of the bang bang lamb fried wontons, and they get eaten up instantly. \\n\\nThe large grill selection comes with a huge container of grilled meat, rice vermicelli patties, sauce, lettuce AND rice paper for wrapping (eater\\'s choice) and tons of basil, cilantro and fresh julienned veggies. The order is always ready exactly when promised, and it goes a looong way. We are always able to accommodate a few surprise additions to the guest list because the Com sizes are so generous. Even picky kids are sucked in to the deliciousness of Com\\'s spread. \\n\\nI highly recommend Com to anyone who\\'s looking for good Vietnamese food. We\\'ve been going there for years, and it never disappoints!',\n",

       "        b'My husband is a local builder and uses several different companies to clean his businesses. When we built our personal house, I wanted to use someone that I felt would do a more thorough job and after scouring Yelp and Google, I kept coming back to this business due to the consistent 5 star reviews and it really pains me to be the person to give this business less than 5 stars. Being that we were first time clients, we were a little put off by the demand for cash or venmo payment in advance because that has never happened with any other cleaning service we have used. I also raised my eyebrow at the fee of $300. While I was hiring her to clean the house post construction, there was absolutely no furniture in the house to work around. We just needed a thorough cleaning to include inside cabinets, around light fixtures and etc. Needless to say, my husband was not impressed and by the time I arrived back in town, our furniture had been delivered so I declined to write a review, instead opting to give her another chance so that I could judge the work being done myself. However, I called and left 2 messages without a return call, so we have hired another service.',\n",

I know this is a harsh statement but we literally couldn't take more than 2 bites of our food. The meat was watery and bland, and tasted like it has been sitting out in the kitchen for 3 days; the whole meal actually.. even the beans had no flavour it was odd. Maybe they served us the display food by accident?!\\n\\nI'm kind of confused on how this place has good reviews. We went here a couple years ago and said we'd never come again. We decided to give it another try. Our mistake. We walked over the road and paid for a second meal at whataburger. The waitress was polite and kind.\",\n",

I was shoved as I was trying to put my jacket on in the front Of the place for no reason by a couple of men who made me feel as if I wasn't supposed to be there as well as on the dance floor several times by numerous men. Hopefully they come out with an actual lesbian bar in this city at some point because this place is nottt lesbian friendly (at least not femme lesbian friendly).\",\n",
       "        b'Worth the read. \\nToday was my very first appointment in Austin since moving here, to get my haircut, and I chose this place due to the location of how close it was to me, and the good reviews on here. I\\'m not sure if I had a bad fluke, or I got the wrong person but I didn\\'t have a great experience. \\n\\nI had Jennifer. Super cool chick, but as SOON as I sat down it was immediately shoving product down my throat. Telling me what I needed to buy, why I needed to buy it, and what it\\'d do for me. Okay great, but, can I tell you what I want to do for my hair, and what type of cut? Well this consisted on continuing for a very long time of her describing all the products. I totally get it, I\\'ve worked in commission based jobs, and I\\'m a server so I get up selling but this lady was going on and on. \\nAbout 10 minutes later we finally go to the back to  wash my hair (still haven\\'t discussed what I want to do) and she\\'s STILL discussing about the products. Telling me what I need to buy, and what I should get, and that\\'s what she is using on my hair, and telling me how it\\'s going to cure my damaged hair. We\\'re done, and go back to the chair, and she is continuing telling me how damaged my hair is, and why I need to buy the products. At this point it\\'s a broken record.\\nFinally we settle on a long bob. Cool. I was leaning towards that anyways. \\n\\nEverything is fine until she goes up to the front, and she rushes back, and says, \"I\\'m sorry but I have another appointment here, so I\\'m not going to be able to style, or show you how to style it but next time I will.\" And she just stops with my hair! Is that unprofessional? I think it is. I\\'m paying you to do my hair, and you stop in the middle cause a walk in comes in? \\n\\nI get home and I see several spots that she didn\\'t evenly trim. I see my sister in law and without even saying anything she goes, \"why is your hair not even? There\\'s so many chunks!\" It\\'d be all one length, and about an inch long of grown hair that was forgotten to be snipped. Maybe if she would have not swept me under the rug during my own appointment she could have finished. \\nAll in all I had to pay somebody to \"start\" my hair, and my sister in law had to finish it. \\n\\nI mean, maybe Jennifer knows what she\\'s doing cause she did pick a good hairstyle for my face shape. But with her overbearingly shoving products down my throat, and cutting my appointment short, and not finishing my hair makes me never want to come back.',\n",
       "        b'Excellent food and drink with awesome ambience. It is great for all occasions. Quite large restaurant with both inside and outside cozy seating arrangement. The food portion is not large but enough for 2 persons. The best part is that street parking is always available for this restaurant, as it is situated in a relatively residential area. Their cheese varieties are great. Do not forget to order some breads with cheese. Other than cheese, I recommend to order Fideos Negros, if you love calamari and squid. They have great selection of cocktails and dessert as well.',\n",
       "        b\"Let me start by saying I have gone there at least twice before my last visit and before then I would have given at least four stars.  Unique and intimate setting.  Good food.  Interesting cocktail list.  Fascinating artwork on the wall.  Expensive, but backed up by rich food.  Trouble is they fumbled in the end game during my last visit.\\n\\nIn my previous visits I am pretty sure we used plastic, debit card, as this is the kind of place where a tab for a table for four gets near $200 pretty quick.  Well on our last visit we hand over the debit card.  The waitress says and thanks and takes the card.  I notice her walk over to the POS station where the card swipe is.  She has some interaction with another waitress and walks back and says they are cash only.  And then informs us that three doors down there is an ATM.  Of course, with no choice, we comply and make the trek there and back.\\n\\nThis bothers me for a few of reasons.\\n\\n1. No signs, or text on the menu anywhere said there were cash only.\\n2. I understand that credit card processors charge fees, but it's a very common cost of doing business.  The City of Brookline charged us to park our car in front of the restaurant - You didn't see us asking Murphy's to feed our meter.  \\n3. It's not realistic that people carry $200 + in their pocket these days.  I understand how using a debit card for a $2.50 pack of gum is silly.  But a $200 tab enters a whole new ballpark and changes the magnitude of the fee in proportion.\\n4. If they are going to have people get up and go to an ATM the least they could do is have an ATM located inside the restaurant...And if they find that it takes up too much room or looks a bit trashy then ... Reactivate the credit swipe and problem solved!\\n\\nIn all this tells me the owner(s) does not respect the customer and is willing to ruin the experience just to save a buck in a restaurant with rather aggressive pricing to begin with.\",\n",
       "        b'GREAT place to \"pregame\" for awesome food and drinks before a night out. I\\'ve only been here during the reverse happy hour (after 10PM), but it\\'s so worth it. Only downside is that service is slow and it\\'s hard to track down a server because they all walk so fast without making eye contact with anyone.. kind of annoying, but after you\\'ve been here once you\\'ll learn to immediately place a first order to get the ball rolling. Sushi is pretty solid, no complaints. My favorite starters include the tofu and seafood salad. The sake bombs are fun especially if you\\'re with a group of friends. As someone who isn\\'t even a fan of beer, I was pleasantly surprised! Such a great deal, and once you get the first round you can keep the plastic cups they serve it in (it has a mini shot cup attached inside for the sake and the beer is poured around it), and then just order hot sake and a few beers separately. \\n\\nSo yes, I\\'d definitely come back for future happy hours. You can\\'t go wrong.',\n",

Which was mobbed and noisy, but that was fine. Great people-watching. \\n\\nWe started with the clam chowder and the fresh baked bread - both delicious ( as was the honey butter that came with it); after enjoying our appetizers, we ordered the half lobster and the lobster roll and the cauliflower. The lobster roll had too much claw meat, which was not tasty, but everything else was very good.  Loved the cauliflower.\\n\\nWe e joyed the fact that we were able to sit and relax and not get pushed to leave.

The almond and pistachio croissants are ridiculously good, and the fact that they are almost always gone is proof enough. The ham & gruyere croissants are usually available and *almost* equally delicious.

Although it is true that the stone bowl was indeed mostly rice with little crab and other toppings.\\n\\nAs for the fish broth, the recommendation was to pour it into the bowl once half of the rice mixture was eaten.

       "        b\"Really overpriced junk. Walked in here one day just to browse around and was yelled at by the owner for having my backpack on. This isn't my first time going into a shop where they wanted you to leave your bags at the front, so I completely get it. But when the first interaction I have with the owner is them yelling at me, kind of doesn't make me want to spend the kind of money they're asking for the stuff they're trying to pawn off onto people.\",\n",
       "        b'I recently went to Del Ara for the first time. I could not have been more pleased. I needed a full foil, highlights and a haircut. I have very curly hair and have had some bad haircuts in my day. My hair stylist that I had gone to for years moved away and I was a little nervous to try someone new. My appointment was with Shaida. She is very knowledgeable about all things relating to hair and patiently explained what she felt I needed to restore my damaged hair to health. I was in the Salon for several hours but the results were definitely worth it. The color and highlights were gorgeous and the haircut was perfect. I also had my eyebrows threaded which was a plus! Thanks Shaida and Marnie for a terrific blowout.',\n",
       "        b\"My friend and I came on a Friday evening for dinner. When we arrived, there was already quite a few people in line, but the entire food court was relatively empty. \\n\\nI ordered the kwa kwa bao combo with dark meat,curly fries, and milk tea boba. Surprisingly, the food came out really quickly by the time we came back from getting our boba from the other side of the food court. The chicken was so delicious and juicy! The skin had the perfect amount of saltiness and I wish I had gotten more! The kwa kwa bao was less flavorful than I had been hoping. Looking back, I wish I had gotten additional chicken instead of that bao. The biscuit was what you'd expect a biscuit to be like - nothing special. I wish it came with some sort of gravy to drizzle on top of it. The curly fries were nothing special. \\n\\nThe cashier was friendly and efficient. I'm glad the food came out so quickly, since we wanted to get away from everyone ASAP. Luckily, we were able to find two bar chairs at the very corner of the food court. \\n\\nOverall, we had a good experience! I don't think I'll be back any time soon, though. Honestly, I feel there are other fried chicken places I'd rather go to.\",\n",
       "        b'Really delicious churros I was very impressed with the taste. The location is not hard to find but something to take into account is the parking situation is kind of hard as there is no parking for the place. There are other businesses near by and parking is reserved strictly for those places. So be careful where you park. Once parked the location has plenty of outdoor seating. Overall a great find highly recommended if your craving some warm churros in Austin.',\n",
       "        b'It\\'s been several years since my last visit to Wink. \\n\\nAnd based on my most recent visit, I might have to say that it might be my last. \\n\\nWe had 8 PM reservations on a Wednesday night. When we got to the restaurant, there were only two other tables occupied. There\\'s no one at the hostess area to greet us. In fact, no one acknowledged us for a couple of minutes. Since there\\'s not a real waiting area at Wink, you basically have to stand at the front of the dining room while everyone stares at you. \\n\\nThe space is less intimate and attractive than I remember. It actually looks a bit dated: like a cheesy wanna be French bistro.\\n\\nFinally, we are seated. \\n\\nMy friend has several food allergies and wanted to make sure that they could accommodate her. Since Wink\\'s own menu says that they can accommodate most diets, she asked our server if the restaurant could prepare something that was vegan, since she can\\'t eat dairy, eggs, fish, or almonds. \\n\\nThe server looked at my friend like she\\'s crazy and asked, \"Where\\'s your special card?\"\\n\\nAll of us at the table were like, wtf. \\n\\nApparently, according to the server, everyone with allergies carries a special card that describes what they cannot eat. \\n\\nOkay, whatever. My friend does not have one. She asked the server if she can just tell her what she can\\'t eat. \\n\\nThe server looks a little perturbed, but agrees to hear my friend out. \\n\\nAfter my friend explained her diet, the server told us that she would go and check with the chef to see if they can make something to accommodate my friend. \\n\\nMany many minutes later, the server comes back to take our order. \\n\\n\"Um, did you check with the chef to see if he can make anything for me?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, yeah, THAT thing.\" \\n\\nFinally, the server comes back and says yes, there is one thing that they can make for my friend. \\n\\nOur other friend asks the server if it\\'s possible just for him to order the prix fixe, if no one else ordered it with him.\\n\\nThe server says no. \\n\\nThen my friend asks if he could move to a different table and order the prix fixe. \\n\\nApparently, yes, this is possible. \\n\\nIncredible.\\n\\nDuring the whole exchange, the server kept reaching out to caress my shoulder.\\n\\nAnd calling me, \"M\\'lady.\"\\n\\nIt was bizarre.\\n\\nTo be honest, I am not sure what was going on with the service at Wink that night. The whole staff felt completely off to us - like they were out of place. I seriously felt like we were at IHOP - except instead of cheap ass pancake platters, we\\'re presented with  pricey tiny plates of food. \\n\\nWhen our food finally arrives, it all tastes pretty good. I really enjoyed my sockeye salmon. \\n\\nHowever, at this price point, there are other places around town that have better food and ambiance.',\n",

I said I  pulled them up in Yelp and it showed a website which I looked at and it said free wifi.   She told my I was wrong and basically hung up on me.\",\n",
       "        b\"After eating lobster rolls and clam chowder for literally a week, I decided to give this restaurant chain a shot. It definitely helped being 100 feet from my hotel. To change things up from what I've been eating I started with the lobster bisque. This was a very good option Asia was creamy and you could really get a taste for the lobster too. After that, I opted for the seafood casserole every though I'd seen some reviews saying to stay away from this dish. I must say it was pretty good. All the seafood that went into it tasted super fresh. It comes out pretty hot with a crispy top layer crust. I think it could have been better if there had been more butter or garlicky flavor as it was described to me. I recommend letting it sit and letting all the flavors mesh. Otherwise good experience and fresh food even for a chain.\",\n",
       "        b\"Great quality food in a nice setting but eye-wateringly expensive.  Rolls and chowder were really nice and surprisingly filling while on the small side.  Lobster bisque was a little salty and rich for my taste.  Nice selection of craft sodas.  But $27 for a roll, soup side and a drink - i'd say $8 or $9 over-priced.\",\n",
       "        b'I\\'ve lived in The North End for a year now and this is the first time I tried Quattro. Ordered takeout. Arugula, fig & goat cheese pizza and meatball madness. \\n\\nArrived to find a kind gentlemen at the door who told me that his colleagues at the end of the bar would gladly help me with my take-out order. I went to the bar, told a young woman I was there for takeout, she said something to the gentleman at the end of the bar and directed me that way. He just looked at me, no smile, no hello how can I help you, he just did a quick chin lift at me with an attitude as if \"what do you want.\" Didn\\'t say a word. I said I was there to pick up a take-out order. Never answered me, looked away and said something I didn\\'t understand to one of the workers, tapped the computer and held his hand out for my payment without even looking at me. He did not say how much the bill was, or even utter a first word. I put my credit card on the counter so he would have to turn around and pick it up. He picked it up, scanned it, and handed me my bill to sign without even saying another word. Once I signed it, he said \"your meatballs will be out in a minute.\"\\n\\nI have never met anyone this rude or unwelcoming that works in the food service industry. Honestly. Shame on him as he gave the restaurant a bad review.\\n\\nThe pizza was very good. I would say I\\'d get it again, but I doubt I will be back to Quattro. The meatballs were just okay. I\\'ve had many better in The North End.\\n\\nWAIT! Now, I just compared my recipe to the menu. Seriously?! Overcharged to boot?!! \\nI did go online (off Yelp) to compare the prices which were what I was charged in the end. \\nSo who\\'s responsible for updating Yelp?

I didn't even want any, but I had several bites more than I planned.   The shrimp fra diavlo was wonderful.   The shrimp was done to perfection and again, the fettucinne so yummy!   There wasn't anything that wasn't terrific.  The cookie for dessert disappeared rapidly.   Sooo good!  We will definitely be back!   Alex and Ian served our party of 4 and they get a 10.

The second time they sent a technician because the heat shut off. He spent 2 hour to fix it. Then 2 days later the problem came back again. Called them back and they are already asking me to pay another $450 to fix it. This company charged me more than $1000 for nothing and my brand new HVAC system that they installed is a wreck and broke down after 2 years. They charge $159/ hr. They were very rude on the phone and no work ethic or customer service at all. Finally they were suppose to come in to fix the outstanding problem and no one showed up.

In fact, it ruined our night. \\n\\nI called the next night to complain and received a curt \"we\\'ll change it in our computer\".

I mention this so you the reader know I have been behind the scenes in vet hospitals since I could walk and seen good, great and terrible practices.  Westlake falls into the last category.\\n\\nI have brought my 3 cats to Westlake Animal Hospital since I moved to Austin; as other reviewers noted, it is certainly expensive, but I love my pets and want to give them \"the best.\"  During my most recent visit, I brought all 3 for wellness exams which include a check-up and bloodwork.  My senior cat is 17 years old and weighs about 10 pounds.  She is an indoor cat and a very sweet and docile animal.  Lanie (who I had never met before) brought her to the back room to obtain bloodwork.  5 minutes later, my cat was brought back to me with her neck covered in blood where several obvious failed attempts to get blood occurred.  She was very frightened and when I asked what happened the vet tech gruffly told me, \"We tried to get blood and she bit another tech.  The rules are we have to report bites to Animal Control.\"  She then left me with my bleeding cat and scurried off to fax the paperwork to Animal Control.  I then paid the almost $700 bill for the check-ups.\\n\\nThe next 2 weeks I was visited by Animal Control daily to inspect my cat for rabies.  I have been given a fine by the city and my 17 year old kitty is labeled a \"dangerous animal.\"  All because a vet tech could not do her job correctly.  They were more concerned with filling out paperwork for a bite that happened on their watch than in taking care of my animals.  DO NOT bring your pet(s) here!',\n",

For the first few months I did what they asked and reduced my price to entice buyers.  After the first year I stopped recieving calls and/or any communication from them, which gave me no hope of it being sold.   Now, August 2013, I receive a call from Timeshares Only.  At first I thought it was an advertising call, because it had been almost 5 years since I heard from them.  Their customer service rep explained to me that I signed up for their service back in 2008 and they wanted to see if the status had changed.  I asked if I could get a refund on my fee since it has not yet sold in 5 years. They said they could not because the money has been used for advertising (search BBB timeshares only, to others response).

Drink specials and half off appetizers. \\n\\nI started out with a orginal frozen margarita to drink and ordered a prickly pear one later on. Also ordered the chips with queso and added venison chorizo. The queso also come with tortillas of your choice. I really enjoyed the queso with the flour torillas and chips, so did everyone else in my party. The complimentary chips and salsa that was served for the table were decent. The salsa had a great spice to it, but not much flavor. However the chips were very tasty, crisp and salted great. \\n\\nFor my own order I got the Verde Enchiladas with chicken served with black beans and rice. I really enjoyed the enchiladas they were tender and the green sauce was flavored great. The beans were a lot better than the rice for me, but the rice still tasted good. \\nMy partner ordered the personal beef fajitas also comes with rice, black beans and tortillas as well. I made a taco with the fajitas on a flour tortilla with all the fixings. I loved the flavor of all the ingredients together; pica de gallo and the guacamole.\\n\\nSo the time comes for dessert, my family had brought a cake for me, but the waitress also bring a slice of flan with a lit candle. Everyone sings happy birthday it was amazing. Now I did not find out until the next day that the flan the waitress brought was on the ticket to pay for... Yet no one ordered that. While this flan tasted great, I don't like the fact that you bring a dessert no one ordered and charge them for that especially if its their birthday. \\n\\nOverall Manuels was a great experience, other than the overcharge. Food tasted amazing, service was quick and they handled a large party failry great. Just double check your tickets becuase our waitress seemed to just place things everywhere from the other groups in our party.\",\n",

       "        b\"When we first began our wedding planning process, things were overwhelming. There were so many options, styles, and details. After hearing that Powers was a partner alongside our venue, we decided to give them a call and chatted through what their services were like. We were sold on how they assigned a photographer to your event - by matching the type of photos and style you liked.\\n\\nWe were paired with Seppi and we immediately knew we would be comfortable and enjoy our time together. We did not do a first look, but we did have a quick in person meeting at our venue to walk through the space and look at where photo places may be. Seppi took charge but also was extremely approachable. He was calm and funny but still commanded attention and natural leadership just oozed from his pores.\\n\\nLeading up to our event, Seppi had an automated system that checked in with us from time to time.It was perfect for people that needed reminders, or had questions that they didnt know the answer to and having his email pop up checking in reminded them to ask. \\n\\nOn our wedding date, Seppi let me know in advance that there was some traffic (we were sitting in it as well!) and kept me abreast of any time he was leaving to go shoot the guys before the ceremony, etc. The second shooter we had that day was amazing as well - her detail shots and guest pictures were really nice to be able to have, since we werent able to enjoy some of those smaller things!\\n\\nSeppi made sure to come up and say goodbye as his time was ending that night and asked if there was anything else we wanted or needed before he left. We had multiple guests say they barely saw him all evening - a true testament to his professionalism in that he didnt need to be all up in people's faces to get the best shots.\\n\\nWe opted to upgrade our package to get photos back within 2 weeks. They actually only sent the teaser at 2 weeks and our full photo package at 3 weeks (which was a bummer and felt a bit like a let down - but only because we were so excited for the full shot rundown). We now have all 800+ photos and can do as we wish with them. I truly appreciate every thing the Powers team did for us and would highly recommend people look into their studio as an option for your upcoming event.\"],\n",

However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\n\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\\xc3\\xa9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\n\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.\",\n",

       "        b\"Disappointing. Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary. They also have a small stock of fabrics that you can order; however, they don't have enough room to display their selections, so it's like trying to paw through your closet when it has twice as many clothes as the racks were meant to handle. \\n\\nThe woman who works there most of the time is very nice and helpful. However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \\n\\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows. Now I don't have the number I wanted, but I can be flexible. What if this had been an upholstery job and my piece was partially completed? Obviously, unacceptable. My advise is to feel free and shop here, but figure out your measurements on your own.\",\n",
       "        b\"I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\",\n",
       "        b'I wish I could give them zero stars. The call takers are rude. The technicians are incompetent. The manager doesn\\'t know what customer service is. It is overpriced. I was quoted $230. I went to another locksmith, who actually got my lock off, and was quoted a total of $79.\\n\\nThe technician was late twice. He could not pick the lock which is not unusual and said he would have to drill through the lock. Ok. But, failed to bring charged batteries. He never offered to come back with charged batteries as soon as he could nor offered to send someone else. He said he could, however, come back around 10 hours later and do it \"under-the-table.\" Usually when you need to get a lock off, you need it off that minute. I said no. He charged me $30 for a service fee...a service that I never received. I contacted the manager, which seems to be a task in itself, and he said that I was rightfully charged $30 because I \"refused\" the technician\\'s offer to come back later. I doubt the manager knew it was an under-the-table payment. I still have not been reimbursed my $30!',\n",

Although the restaurant/bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender  (Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt service with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \\n\\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.\\n\\nThe real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!

       "        b\"I just had my lasik done last week and I am really happy with my results. The staff were all extremely nice, remembered me like I was an old friend, and generally made me feel very comfortable. It's also great that they have Saturday appointments. The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\\n\\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \\n\\nI believe I've made a great investment. I still can't believe I'm going to see this well FOREVER! :-) \\n\\nMy only complaint was that they didn't administer a sedative or anything to help me relax during the surgery (and maybe a pain Rx for after?) I didn't feel nervous before it started, but a little panic hit me when my eye was being held open and I was asked to keep my eye very still.\\n\\nOh, and they charge $2100 per eye for the all-laser lasik.\",\n",

I received a free foot salt scrub due to a scheduling issue, not bad! When a company offers you something in addition due to a mistake on their part, take it!

No harm no foul. \\nThe foul part came when we entered our room. The carpet was soggy near the bathroom and the entire room was permeated with a musty smell. Something along the lines of aeu-de-someone-flooded-the-toilet. \\nAfter unpacking--which I shouldn\\'t have done, but I\\'m a sucker for any opportunity for sticking things out and making them work.

I didn\\'t ask--which clearly you can see from this point means I have some sort of timidness for communication. I really need to outgrow that. \\nLong story short, by the time she had hosed down the carpet, walls, and doorways with her spray bottle, we were left coughing and choking on the fumes and were forced to spend the night with the door open in a weak attempt to ventilate the room.\\nI did not leave my heart in FL. but I may have donated a small portion of lung tissue. \\nYou\\'re probably asking...\"but did you die?\" \\nI am very much alive.

Sure, it's not as fast, but Boston's not nearly as big as NYC, so it's fast enough.  Compared to any other public transit in the US, the red line is awesome. \\n\\nLook, all of the MBTA -- the trains, the busses, the stops -- they are all showing signs of neglect. It's in debt by several billion dollars. So they're not going to add any fancy new features or do any serious upgrading until they have money to pay for it.

       "        b'This has not been a pleasant experience. According to our server, the restaurant is short on staff. This means our service has been frightfully slow. We have been here over an hour with receiving our food. Most of the food was good, except for the steak that was tough. This is a trendy place. Great spot to be seen. Food is just okay.',\n",
       "        b'\"A Bit Embarrassed\"\\n\\nI\\'m not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my - or everyone\\'s- meal comped last night.\\n\\nYes, I\\'m doing the Eat On $30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn\\'t want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.\\'s, Emily R.\\'s and Alain L.\\'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I\\'m so used to dining out, I couldn\\'t resist, I suppose!!\\n\\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.\\'s grits side and Emily R.\\'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we\\'re Yelpers, so we\\'re gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\\n\\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin\\'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.\\'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron\\'s wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\\n\\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he\\'d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\\n\\nI have to say . . . I\\'m \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I\\'m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it\\'s a gracious gesture on management\\'s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn\\'t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn\\'t *really* care, he noted he\\'d worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you\\'re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\\n\\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary\\'s once noting how sloooow everyone\\'s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn\\'t) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn\\'t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\\n\\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .',\n",

       "        b'Just had Yalla for lunch today. I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred\\'s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\\n\\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.',\n",
       "        b\"Overall Recommendation:  If you like fried chicken, you should definitely check this place out.  Be forewarned that it's not a nice restaurant like the Flying Biscuit or Mary Macs so adjust your expectations for decor and service.  My husband and I are not from the South but as we ate our way through Atlanta, the Busy Bee Cafe ranked #1 on both our lists.\\n\\nPros\\n  - BEST FRIED CHICKEN WE'VE EVER HAD...perfectly crispy skin with \\n    great flavor. It seriously makes me not very excited to eat fried chicken \\n    anytime soon because I know anywhere I go in Boston won't be as \\n    good.\\n  - Ribs with a nice, smokey taste\\n  - Super mac n' cheese made with real cheese\\n  - Dang good corn muffins you can munch on before your food arrives.\\n\\nCons\\n  - Very busy so be prepared to wait (and you should because it's worth it)\\n  - No air conditioning so in the summer it can get pretty toasty.  We were \\n    there at the end of June and even with the fans going, it was warm.\\n  - Sweet tea is too sweet for me\\n\\n**Note: There's a small parking lot as well as street parking.  However if you park on the street, the meters are really expensive...something crazy like $2 an hour.\",\n",

First, it look a long time for my food to come out, and the waitress initially brought the wrong order. Then, it look 20 minutes before I was able to chase down the waitress to pay my check. Finally, when I received my check, they charged dinner pricing for a lunch. I was running late to get back to the office, so I paid it, but all said, the service was inexcusable.

It was also small portions, about a fourth of an artichoke in size. Even after sending back the artichoke it still was tough and not fully cooked. \\n\\nWe ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected. For $35 we received two lamb chops with a tasty mustard sauce but the accompanying vegetables were tasteless and again, disappointing.

       "        b\"My husband and I shared the parmesan truffly fries. They were pretty good and plentiful. Two to three can definitely share. I'm a vegetarian and was going to order the La Bandita. However, the waitress suggested the goodnight burger with a veggie patty. It sounded great so I opted to try it. After all, this was my first visit to a Hopdoddy and she would know better than I would. Despite the different elements, the burger to me was very bland. The patty didn't have much flavor and there wasn't much sauce. (When the waitress pitched the burger, she said it have more flavor than the La Bandita because of the sauce. Since I'm all about the sauce, it helped to sell me on this burger.) \\n\\nJust a note on the Impossible burger: I'm a vegetarian that does not miss meat or the flavor of meat. Because this burger tries to replicate the texture and flavor or meat, it really turned me off.\\n\\nMy husband went with the classic and added bacon and cheese. The burger arrived with only cheese (no bacon). He said it was alright but he didn't rave about it in a way that told me he was in love with it.\\n\\nWe ordered a banana shake that was one of their feature items. It wasn't as thick and not ice cold as we would expect for a shake. It was much closer to room temperature and had a thin consistency.\\n\\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would definitely try the La Bandita to give that burger a shot. A quick note about the line: it moved pretty quickly. Once we got inside, a couple of spots opened up at the bar and the waitress invited us over to sit there. We jumped at the opportunity and saved about another 10 minutes in line.\",\n",

       "        b'Overall can be a great experience if you\\'re a regular and know what you are doing. You pick your car, get in, and you go. However for the rest of us like myself with family in toll, don\\'t expect much customer assistance. Upon arriving to the National garage at MCO, we did not see anyone in the attendant booth so we proceeded to \"choosing our car\" (I am an Emerald\\'s Club member so we got to pick any car from the respective lane). The caveat is I had a car seat reserved as well for my little one. After we chose our car and had my family inside our chosen vehicle (garage is located outdoors and it\\'s FL) I proceeded to head back to the attendant\\'s help for the car seat. Still no attendant, waited another 10 min before someone showed up. When he finally came back, no personal greetings and was a bit short when I asked about the car seat, he pointed to a pile of car seats on a shelf and walked away. Forget about any type of help with installation. Can be a bit tricky inside a covered garage (dark), an unfamiliar car seat, toddler crawling around the car and did I mention the FL weather...\\n\\nThe return was a breeze, you proceed to the designated lane and grab your stuff to go.

So worth it!\\n\\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\\n\\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\\n\\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\\n\\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\\n\\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\\n\\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese / gorgonzola yumminess.\",\n",

       "        b'I\\'m having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they\\'re using Yelp in the right way - they\\'re using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I\\'ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I\\'ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that\\'s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren\\'t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn\\'t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\\n\\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn\\'t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There\\'s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn\\'t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren\\'t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\\n\\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I\\'m kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn\\'t pay extra, that wasn\\'t really a deal breaker for me.\\n\\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.',\n",

Mainly for grilled cheese, which apparently takes 45 minutes to make.  Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something?  Who knows.  But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\\n\\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\\n\\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.\",\n",

Free WiFi and a location right next to the Book Loft ensure that this place will always be doing business, despite the Starbucks across the street.\",\n",
       "        b\"Falafel wrap - falafel with greens, pickles, and hummus in  a toasted wrap. I wonder why the reviews were so low. I entered without looking at yelp initially but then after checking in and seeing the amount of stars I kind of grew the assumption that it wasn't going to be good.  But it was really good. This was probably the best falafel wrap I ever had. They pressed the wrap too so it has a nice crunch but still soft to chew. The falafels weren't bland and each bite tasted the same, which makes wraps great, since it's evenly disturbed. \\n\\nThey are far from cheap on the stuffing so eat up! The wait time wasn't long during their busy time and it's a good portion for a hungry person, so I suggest checking this place out.\",\n",
       "        b\"If this isn't your first time at the specialty coffee rodeo and if you know you're way around a pour over, burr grinder, and espresso machine then most likely you will be slightly annoyed that the baristas talk to you like you've never heard of pour over and that they are the only place in Boston that serves good specialty coffee. I know coffee, am passionate about coffee, and Im always looking for the best roaster out there.  George Howell is a legend but the coffee here is honestly not that impressive.\\n\\nOne story - I ordered an Ethiopian pour over and asked for it to be made on the machine instead of by hand as I wanted to watch the machine in action. I paid $4 with my CC. I was then told that they don't have any Ethiopian but they would make me Kenyan which is very similar (not in my opinion but ok I'll go with it - there was Ethiopian on the shelf so I'm a little confused... why can you just go grab it and make it for me? That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes. And after drinking it I am never asked how it was, if I was ok with them switching out the coffee I ordered.  I don't know about you but I expect more. \\n\\nI've decided that my coffee money is better spent elsewhere supporting people and roasters that are starting out. Sorry George, but ya let me down.\",\n",

Finally we were moved to another server's section, who basically treated us like crap as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really can't figure out why we stayed?  Cheap beer, I guess.

       "        b\"That was very gratifying!  Sometimes, I just crave a really good burger and fries with a coke.  PDX Sliders delivered without the guilt. Their sliders are about three inches across, small, but packs a lot of flavor and satisfying.  My sister order the Morrison which was an herb-marinated chicken with bacon, pesto, baby arugula, and aioli on Ciabatta.  I ordered two, the Sellwood and Hawthorne--one to split with her.  The Sellwood consisted of a beef, patty, bacon, aged sheddar, caramelized onions, butter lettuce, aioli and the Hawthorne had a beef patty, bacon, goat cheese, strawberry preserves on Brioche.  Of course, she wanted to share the Hawthorne.  I took a bite of the Hawthorne first and didn't want to give the rest to her.  It was so succulent!  The sweetness of the preserves with the tang of the goat cheese complimented the medium-rare beef patty well.  My sister didn't care for the Morrison, she felt that it was something that she could've made at home and the Sellwood was delicious but very typical burger flavors.  Love that their truffle fries are super crispy!  I think there will be more Hawthorne burgers in my future. While sitting at the benches eating, I was surprise that they get a lot weird people constantly walking by for that area.\",\n",
       "        b\"My husband and I have done business with Beaverton Toyota 3 times and each time, they've blown me away at the service they've provided (I mean that in a good way). We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! \\nI brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.\",\n",

If you're a fan of Mexican food, especially if you're from out of town just go here and eat. Parking isn't bad, your seated immediately and there is always a table available. Unfortunately there can sometimes be minor communication errors with your waitresses and the staff so make sure to be very clear with what you want when placing your Oder.

I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn\\'t drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn\\'t help at all so I don\\'t know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn\\'t like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don\\'t care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.  It\\'s obvious the workers don\\'t want to be there.  Stay away from this store and Sprint',\n",

I've never had a problem, the service is always top notch, and the place is always squeaky clean - dining area, exterior, bathrooms, even the kitchen appears much cleaner than other fast food place from what I can see. I love their fried chicken liver and the manager told me that because they make each batch fresh that they are happy to take my order over the phone if I call ahead so that I don't have to wait at the restaurant for the 6 minutes or so that it takes to cook. I live just down the street and I have taken them up on this offer several times. Even if it's just one order of 6 chicken livers, they are happy to cook them up fresh so they are ready when I arrive. Now THAT is exceptional customer service. Thanks Chicken E!\",\n",

The tables are large and seat multiple parties together at each table, so it feels like you're at a party -- a party for awesome people. \\n\\nThe menu is small, which is nice for the indecisive. We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \\n\\nFor the entr\\xc3\\xa9e, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting. Do not get the bok choy as your vegetable side however - it was not cooked very well and I could not appreciate the flavors of garlic and lemon. \\n\\nDefinitely a cool place to eat and greet, I can't wait to come back to try more things on the menu.\",\n",

       "        b\"I was in Austin recently and searched for a place to eat on this fine website called Yelp. We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!!\\n\\nFirst of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\\n\\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven.\\n\\nOur waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here. I will make it a point to come back the next time I'm in town.\",\n",
       "        b\"I used to love this place.  The food is very good, and thankfully that hasn't changed.  However, after eating there about 12-15 times (usually the same dish), I noticed the portions were smaller than ever.  I asked the waitress, and she said it's the same as always.  She's been there for a while, so she obviously knows the difference and is just denying it.  It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \\n\\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \\n\\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.  Like I said, the food is tasty, but I might boycott this place just for the principal of it.\",\n",
       "        b\"My brother in law suggested this place, and we came here right after arriving in Orlando, so we were starving.\\n\\nThe service was good, the food was absolutely terrible. Every single dish. I ordered the mofongo de camarones (shrimp with mashed plantain). The shrimp came separate, and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor - it didn't even taste like garlic! The sauce that typically comes with this dish (in a separate cup) looked and tasted like oil. So gross.\\n\\nI would never eat here again.\",\n",
       "        b'Will not be back!!! The service was just awful. We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it. However, I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added. So, they decided to take it grudgingly. The food was only decent. The location is in some shady strip mall. The value was just okay. When we were about to pay, the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the 1/2 off Scoutmob deal, so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except $8 difference...REALLY?!? She added the 18% tax but also a so-called Scoutmob fee...RIDICULOUS!!!!',\n",
       "        b\"Let me start by saying this place is lucky my girlfriend isn't the one reviewing it because she is far harsher.\\n\\nDecor works.  You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\\n\\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\\n\\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\\n\\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\\n\\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\\n\\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.  Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.\",\n",

Also, they provide free water bottles, which helped when I had a hangover the next morning on our way out. \\n\\nMy room had 2 full size beds in it and a bathroom that connected to the bedroom as well as a door that led to the main room. The place was absolutely clean- bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, living room. My supervisor\\'s bathroom had a huge tub in it. Also, the coffee and tea was Starbucks, so that was a big plus. \\n\\nI love this place so much. It was safe at night, the bartenders were cool and friendly. They directed us to places to check out as well as noted the vibe. (Half the group wanted a ratchet time while the other half wanted a chill, \"shoot pool\" time.)

Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor...\\n\\nStephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns. She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription. And a $20 co-pay for not seeing an actual doctor. Hmm. \\n\\nTook several months of the medication and saw no difference. I call the office to see if I can up the dosage (which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn't effective) and I was told I need to book an appointment. Oh, I see. I get medication that doesn't work and have to come in and pay yet another co-pay just to have the dosage changed (as was suggested the first time).

If this store actually does accept your used clothes/purses (which is an obstacle in itself, unless you have the style of a 13 year old) they really don't offer a lot.

I gained strength very quickly, even going just once a week, but the biggest benefit I have found is that my 75-minute class is the ONLY time in my entire week that I can honestly say my mind is 100% in the present moment. When I'm at aerial practice I don't think about anything else in my life except exactly what I'm doing. I'm concentrating, getting a workout and laughing so hard every single class. It is the best therapy out there, I swear. The groups in each class are small enough to get lots of individual attention from the instructors, so you learn something new every time, and we all support and encourage one another as we're attempting new, challenging skills. I can't say enough positive things about this place...you just HAVE to try it!\",\n",

They serve shakes with a little alcohol.  Yes, a little alcohol.\\n\\nThe decor at Grub Burger is modern.  Sleek.  We were confused at first when we arrived, but a server came up and explained for us to take a menu and order in the back.  \\n\\nDrew and I shared The Front Porch burger (just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.) cooked medium-well, onion ring and a Java Jitters spiked milkshake.\\n\\nThe Front Porch Burger was delicious. The meat was fresh and tasted like a burger should taste.  They advertise on their menu that the hamburger is actually brisket and ground chuck.

Also, there is very little alcohol.  i prefer Grindhouse milkshakes instead.\\n\\nThe onion rings lacked seasoning.

It was so loud from the children in the waiting area,  the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation  (including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. \\nThe food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don't regularly go to the OG and don't expect too much, they didn't improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills.  On all dishes there was very little sauce.  The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed (red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce.\",\n",

The server brought us our crab and told us that the crackers were in the washer and would be out in a minute or two. Then 10 minutes passed, still no utensils, we asked again and a different server told us that they didn't have any more, that they kept going missing. This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The staff then avoided our table.  We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.  I would give them a negative star if I could. The food was NOT worth the money it cost us.\",\n",

It came out on a small saucer and contained maybe a 1/2 c of each for $10.75.  I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $5 for the lavas bread (what was I suppose to eat with the dips).  Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.\\n\\nI know I will not come back to eat here.

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.\\nFor about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. \\n\\nSo I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.\\n\\nAND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.\",\n",

When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \\n\\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \\n\\nThere are some things that were still delicious. I love the waffles still. And the focaccia is great. But for the high expectations that arise from the price, hype and 45 minute wait each time, Cafe Medina is absolutely awful.\",\n",

It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. \\n\\nA few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.\\n\\nThe drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.\",\n",

I do not recommend staying here if you depend on a reliable internet connection.  Staff state it is a free service so it should not matter if it works or does not work, and there will be no further effort to fix this ongoing issue.\\n\\nThe quality of the food for breakfast was slightly below that of a school cafeteria.  The waiter was surprisingly inattentive given that there was only one other table to serve (at minimum I expect a single glass of water).\\n\\nIt takes about 3-5 minutes to enter the room due to the quirky key card system; one must insert and remove the card timed perfectly or the lock faults and the process need to be retried.\\n\\nIn spite of the above, the beds were comfortable.',\n",

This was  an excellent decision (and no larks were harmed in the process).\\n\\nThe restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th.  The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food.\\n\\nWe had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer.  They were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well.\\n\\nFor dinner my girlfriend had the green chile polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.  I've eaten redfish cooked a variety of ways across the gulf coast but the spiced crust and habenro butter made it very exotic and thoroughly enjoyable.  \\n\\nI'd reccomend this place to anyone who's never had cuisine from the tropics, or to anyone who wanted to get some great food at a reasonable price.\",\n",

You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. \\n\\nThe only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything (I still tipped though, I'm not a scumbag.) \\n\\nBoston Tea Stop (clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. \\n\\nAlso the staff deserves a shout-out.

My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it. Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register. But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with 3 at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed. I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything. At the end of the day there are several people in this world looking for work and can't find it while we have people like the ones I encountered today with positions they are clearly abusing.

       "        b\"Point #1 - Haggle Free?\\n\\nNow if you know anything about the East Coast, you know that EVERYTHING gets haggled and negotiated.  I have this down to a science.  I am the chick that all sales reps eventually cower in fear from and pour themselves a stiff whiskey after selling | not selling me a car | truck | couch | designer purse | [insert purchasable item here].  Imagine my surprise when I move out here that in addition to no Dunkin Donuts and Chinese Food delivery at 3AM, Honda is a HAGGLE FREE ZONE. Simply unacceptable.  \\n\\nI pleaded with them to REDUCE THEIR PRICE.  Of course, there is HIDDEN MARKUP and stuff.  Take it down.  Do it NOW.  I NEED the satisfaction of knowing that I beat my sales rep to a quivering pulp of low price jelly with elaborate tactical accuracy..  Winning is what fuels me. \\n\\nInstead, they offered me this non-negotiable price.  I tried everything I could.  I plead.  I whined.  I walked out the door (and then I came back).  Nothing worked.  Negotiation, haggling and bargaining is my life.  My soul.\\n\\nConclusion:  I don't like non-negotiable pricing.  Bleh.\\n\\n\\nPoint #2 - Prices are insane??\\n\\nOnce upon a time in a land far far away (New Jersey), I bought a Toyota from a dealership.   Somewhere in that dealership there is a photo of me standing in front of a Toyota 4 Runner. Now I was not exactly photogenic for that photo (chubby, yet adorably cute.  A big shout out to Toyota and Weight Watchers!!!\\n\\nNow buying a car from them was a BIG DEAL!!!  In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \\nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\\n\\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \\n\\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \\n\\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\\n\\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \\n\\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...\",\n",

Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor.  \\n\\nThe reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the service.  It was remarkable.  The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded.  The manager also came over to apologize.

Just had my actual procedure yesterday and the whole process from start to finish was seamless. I'm 39 years old and have struggled with contacts and glasses for years and years. I only wish I had opted for Laser much sooner. TLC is definitely a reputable center with a reputable surgeon and trained support staff. The overall cost seems pricey compared to other offers, but well worth the peace of mind and care provided.\",\n",

       "        b\"I love massages, good massages that is. And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \\n\\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\\n\\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \\nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself. They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day!!\",\n",

       "        b\"I'm less than impressed with Sweet. Like several others, I also found them a tad sweet for my taste, although not unbearably so. More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I've had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry.\\n\\nIt was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry. I've never put a cupcake down before without finishing it, but for the first time I did. \\n\\nThis is not my idea of a perfect bite of cake and frosting. These bakers could learn a lot from the cupcake shops in DC and New York.\",\n",
       "        b\"Channing is a photo ninja.\\n\\nMy parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted.  The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\\n\\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\\n\\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\\n\\nSeeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\\n\\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\\n\\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.\",\n",

       "        b\"I was surprised when I read the reviews of MM, but after using them for my initial CPAP experience and then follow on visits, I learned a lot. When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\\n\\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones. However, those that appear to have good ratings, may not take your insurance. The highest rated one took none of ours. That would mean everything out of pocket.\",\n",

I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \\n\\nLet\\'s start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \\n\\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn\\'t be done,  until Neil came along....\\n\\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \\n\\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \\n\\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol. When done I got a care package of tattoo balm which increased my healing time and a cool t-shirt which I wear often with pride. \\n\\nGo with cash, I had to use an atm across the street, no biggie, but we all know cash is king!! Have cash to tip also, these people are artists and cash tips are necessary!\\n\\nLastly there is ample parking across the street adjacent to advance auto. Do not park in advances\\' parking lot, park on the public street or risk being towed!!!\\n\\nI look forward to rebooking with Neil.  Follow him on Facebook and instagram to see if he has cancelations. His appointments are COVETED,  do not rush him and do not miss your appointment.\\n\\nEmpire tattoo is clean,  friendly and professional.  \\nI have been in a few places and left running...Empire IS THE ONLY PLACE YOU NEED TO GO FOR A TATTOO  and I highly recommend Neil. The other artists seemed great too, but it\\'s the work of NEIL ENGLAND,  that I wear with pride...thanks Neil....',\n",

All these one star reviews had me worried, but not as worried as I was about getting my husband some help ASAP. \\n\\nWhen we got in they told us they could see him right away, but if it wasn't an emergency he'd be sent outside to wait for a while. It didn't take long for them to realize it was an emergency. And from that moment on he was treated with the best care. The nurses were all really sweet and had great bedside manner, distracting my husband while giving him an injection, and one even brought us a snack (we had planned to eat breakfast at the airport). The front desk guy, who was struggling with our health care information, was nice as he could be about it. And the doctor was better than most primary care physicians I've had -- very patient, forthcoming with all information, and seemed genuinely concerned for his wellbeing. \\n\\nWe left with a less-dying husband, feeling perfectly cared for, and with TWO doctors notes that will help us get a refund on our missed flights. \\n\\nThanks, team!

This place is just raw art that anyone can contribute to.  Bring your spraypaint and mark your place in history.  I was advised by the locals here that this place may no longer be here in the near future.  Just like all the other spots in Austin, this is prime location for building other types of establishments.\\n\\nI love that there are no frills here.  If you want to take a picture and get as close to the wall as possible, you will have to walk through some dirt,  climb up some broken concrete, and cross over some bums, homeless people, or freelance hipster artists trying to make a name for themselves.  Just do it, its worth it.  I wish i did.  But I was peer pressured by my friends to hurry up and take my selfie.\\n\\nI would love to come back and climb that wall all the way to the top.

You can keep eating for hours if you want, and they just keep on refilling your broth and items if you ask them for it.  They don't exactly offer to bring you things without you asking, but they were not the least bit rude about giving us another check off sheet. \\n\\nWe had the chef's special broth and it was extremely bland, but the dipping sauce (satay and soy based) was not too bad.

Also, we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be \"nail size\" or we will be charged for the repair.

The cake was dry- really, really dry.  Stuck in my throat and felt like sandpaper dry.  The frosting, by contrast was sweet- really, really sweet.  Cloyingly sweet- really quite unpleasant.  I ended up throwing 1/2 of each away- it was really that bad.  \\nI think they have a great concept that is very on trend, great packaging and store design, a great location and a customer base who will pay through the nose for a cupcake- but honestly... it isn't all about marketing!

I ordered the house pho, took my number and headed downstairs. Set in five points, this place is busy but they have plenty of seating. The pho was delivered shortly after i found a seat. The broth at first taste is a bit sweet and doesn't exactly have a beefy, pho taste. I will say that once lime, basil, and a bit of chili oil were added, the flavor developed and became more savory.  The flank was well done when it got to the table. I would suggest meatball or the brisket before the flank. While this was not my favorite pho, it still hit the spot and provided a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of attending a conference.\",\n",

       "        b'This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before. \\n\\nRegarding reliability and customer service, this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with.    Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \\n\\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn\\'t find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \\nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \\n\\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \\n\\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \\n\\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don\\'t know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\\n\\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: \\' the situation is a lil risky for me\\'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \\n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro \\'was late\\'!  \\nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \\n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was \\'proceeding to cancel this call\\'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \\n\\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \\n\\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \\nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.',\n",

I work in the restaurant scene in Boston and frequently dine at excellent places, but I keep coming back to the Wolf for my casual night out. \\n\\nQuest is MAGIC\\n\\nHowling Wolf Burrito - why do i EVER let myself get anything else??? ( because I want to try everything, that's why). It's just SO perfect. Try it. Just do it. You'll die. \\n\\nI also love the chorizo papusa appetizer. Little spice, complimented by a vinegary slaw of come sort. Fish taco is phenomenal as well. \\n\\nService is fine. Bar can be understaffed at times (one on doing the whole bar plus service) which creates a slower-than-desired experience. \\n\\nAfter I finally move out of Salem into Boston, I will be at the Wolf whenever I come up here to visit friends.\",\n",
       "        b\"I would definitely stay here again. \\n\\nSome of the reviews are a bit harsh.. and I'm not sure why. If you're a hotel/motel snob, then this probably isn't the place for you. However, if you want a comfortable, clean, affordable place to rest your head, with speedy shuttle service and decent cafeteria food within walking distance, than this is your place! \\n\\nThe property is huge, so like the parks, be prepared to do a bit of walking! The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other. I also like the designated smoking areas which keep the cigarette smoke away from your room. My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \\n\\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \\n\\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria. I don't know if we were just starving when we got back from the parks, but the Chicken Parmesan was pretty outstanding. They also have overpriced beer in the coolers if you're feeling tense. ;)\",\n",
       "        b'I\\'ve always liked Flip (I\\'ve been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions - Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened  when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. \\n\\nThis past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating (two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1\\'s mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the \\'Haute Dog\\' made it. \\n\\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you\\'re looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\\n\\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn\\'t disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the \\'Oaxaca\\' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there\\'d be. Always a plus!\\n\\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there\\'s a muti flavor component to them as well. \\n\\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\\n\\nMy one tiny complaint/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side - and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?',\n",
       "        b\"Just had a shellac mani/pedi. I'm usually pretty fair in the sense that I expect to get what I pay for. And since this is one of the lower-priced nail salons in the area, I didn't come in with extremely high expectations. But even with my modest expectations, I was seriously disappointed with this place. The tools used for my pedicure and manicure looked overused and unsanitary, the women in the salon carried on a conversation at the top of their lungs the entire time I was there, and my nails were unevenly shaped. I will definitely be finding another salon in the area.\",\n",

Thanks goodness for the power outage last week! I convinced him to go here (\"like dim sum honey- only Spanish food...you know, like jamon???!!!\"). From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can\\'t imagine anything here not being delish). After our meal, Pepe suggested a sherry for desert and he was spot on. He chatted with us for awhile and it was most enjoyable.\\nCannot wait to go back!\\nPros: everything\\nCons: need more friends so we can order more variety :)',\n",

We had to wait in line for a little while but the man at the front made it go by quicker by asking us trivia questions. There was a fair amount of seating and my group of 6 didn't have trouble finding a table. I got the sour guava for my first drink which I enjoyed. The second I had was their milk stout. It was fine but I can say I've had better. I really liked their 'bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch. Some things I didn't take advantage of was the chocolate bar, the arcade games, or the tasting room restaurant in the back, but definitely things I want to try next time I'm there!\",\n",

We had the recommended lava bread with babaganoush (to die for!) for an appetizer and then the recommended mixed platter for two for $35. We got a side of cucumber/garlic tzatziki and the savory iskander tomato sauce. Simply amazing and still leftovers! You have to get the kunefe dessert with some Turkish coffee (watch out for the 1/4 cup of coffee grinds at the bottoml lol). For the chocolate lovers, the chocolate hazelnut baklava is delectable and rich. The best time would be to go during happy hour with half off drinks. Fantastic!',\n",

All we asked for was a salad and a pizza and for the second time in a row, no salad arrived.  At least they didn't put it on the bill this time.   I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM.  Maybe the staff should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs.  And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent.  Not a good showing last night.  It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.   Great pizza can overcome poor service, but fair pizza and poor service?  That's a tough sell.\",\n",

The unlimited option was definitely the way to go.\\n\\nNow, buffets can be tempting, but keep in mind that the best stuff comes right to your table ON A SWORD.  We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry.\\n\\nThe fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin.  There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible.  \\n\\nBe sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like.\\n\\nA special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California.  Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven.\\n\\nThere's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett.\\n\\nThe value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience.  I will definitely be back.\",\n",

I also like the noodle dishes(Chow Chow). The vegetables are always fresh and crisp(Tsel Tomma, Tsel Tofu). I would recommend this place for vegetarian meals alone, but the beef(Langsha Tsel Nesom), pork(Phaksha Solo) and chicken(Chhasha Curry) dishes are very good too.

       "        b\"Precision Moving Company did an amazing job moving our belongings from Brookline to Cambridge last week. Jeff and Kevin showed up on time and did a one minute scan of our stuff, coming up with a mental plan for how to pack the truck in the most efficient way. They cleaned everything out in record time, and were flexible when we uncovered and threw some extra stuff at them at the last minute. The approach to our new apartment is challenging, with multiple sets of stairs and gravel to deal with. They handled these with ease. The trickiest part was our giant overstuffed leather couch which was actually bigger than the door or the stairway. Although they weren't 100% sure it would fit, they gave it a shot and through a series of clever maneuvers they got it up the stairs and into place. The best testament to their professionalism is that as they were headed back to the truck after spending 15 minutes muscling our couch up a pretty insane set of stairs, they weren't complaining, they were complimenting each other on a tough problem well solved. They obviously take pride in their work and we'll never use a different moving company again!\",\n",

The quality is certainly reflected in the price. Though I don't shop here often, I always feel like I'm in Handbag-Heaven when I walk in! \\n\\nI wish Toronto had their own Ferragamo boutique shop, instead of just the varieties available at Holts.

A great date night and some tasty treats (for those not familiar with Himalayan food, there is a bit of something for everyone, curries and things that sounds like what you might find at Indian restaurants, to other things that are quiet apart).

He is an ARTIST. I brought pictures in to show him what I was going for, talked about how my thick straight hair lays flat on my head like a dead raccoon in the hot/humid summer, asked if he could please cut it (and show me how to style it) so that it doesn't do that. He did some amazing techniques (which my previous $90 stylist had never done), and my haircut is AMAZING. He explained everything, from how to blow dry to how to use the products to get the look I wanted. He was extremely professional, fun to talk to, and most importantly, extremely talented. He took his time to make my cut perfect (he says he's a little OCD, which I think is a good thing when it comes to haircuts) and while the cut took quite a while, it's PERFECT. My hair is adorable. I feel beautiful! Am going to take a picture today to post with this review.\",\n",

An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom\\'s closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I\\'m a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I\\'m usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I\\'m not. I\\'m not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\\n\\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That\\'s fine with me.\"\\n\\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office!

Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done.

The wait during lunch is tolerable; which is a rare find during the lunch hour....however, me and several of my devoted co-workers would appreciate if the full menu was served before 3 PM. There have been multiple occasions during which this location has lost service due to the lack of full menu during working hours. The tatted bartender has been incredibly welcoming and apologetic during (lack of lunch service) and at these times. He should be recognized for his great efforts for maintaining service at this establishment.',\n",
       "        b\"I went to comedor with my boyfriend for date night. I'm a huge fan of small plates, and comedor is the perfect place for a unique and eclectic blend. The food was DELICIOUS, but what was even more awesome was the ambiance. The place is small, dimly lit, but very lively. Tables were full, but we were able to immediately sit at the bar. I'm happy we did, because that's where all the magic happens! The chefs cook right behind the bar. Admittedly, I drooled the entire time while waiting for our food. They do give complimentary bread to start, so I didn't drool for too long. :-) Overall, this is a cozy spot for an intimate date night.\",\n",
       "        b'Consistently good mexican food. Not a super diverse menu, but not just a taco or burrito only menu either. Decent prices and friendly service.',\n",
       "        b\"Still a fan of the maki and the specials, but I've decided that everyone should pass on the margaritas.  I've tried several of their unique margaritas, which sound fun but taste awful.  I had the watermelon one last night and couldn't take more than 2 sips because it was so sour.\\n\\nStick with their beer or saki.\",\n",
       "        b\"I had been coming here for years, but Habana's has lost it ways. The food was so bad and expensive.  Bad food that cost a lot leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off.  The drink menu does not have prices,  this is because a glass of wine is 10 dollars.  The $23 Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky.  \\nThere are NOW much better Cuban here in Austin, let this one fade away.\",\n",
       "        b\"Stayed there for business the other day. Checked in Sunday night at the tail end of ACL. The staff was very attentive, and helpful. I use to live, and work in Hostels in different parts of the world, and in the U.S., and the Firehouse is a damn good one. The lounge on the first floor is a great little Austin haunt full of that famous Austin uniqueness that facilitates great adventures. The prices are really good considering the location, and the selection is also above average. Bathrooms very clean, and common areas are not neglected. People staying there are nice, and no donkeys that I could I see. A place that I will be going to again. Didn't wake up for the free breakfast, but I'm sure I'm not the first. Smelled good though.\",\n",
       "        b'I went with a group of 25 for a fun Sunday afternoon activity and we all had such a great time!\\nMaking reservations was easy and I love that they allow people to pay individually (which made planning so much easier) AND you can bring in your own food/drink!  We brought in pizzas from Dante\\'s and they were nice enough to set up a small fold-out table to help keep us organized.\\n\\nThe staff were so kind and accommodating to our group - from explaining how the painting worked to answering questions and giving tips throughout our time there (ie. \"You\\'ll want another layer of paint on that\") to engaging in fun conversation with people.  They let us stay longer than the 2-hour time frame and only asked to rearrange us a bit.\\n\\nThey had a great assortment of pieces to paint - from practical to decorative.  Price ranged from about $8-$30.  Stencils are also available for the artistically challenged!\\n\\nAll in all, a really fun activity and a great option if you\\'re looking for a group activity. They were wonderful hosts and looked to please their patrons.\\n\\nPS - You don\\'t have to pay if you don\\'t finish but can return at any time to complete it.',\n",
       "        b'This sushi -go-around is your typical \"franchise-like\" sushi joint.  Not the best sushi by any means, however the variety of items at decent prices compensate for any lacking. I like their seaweed/salad rolls--a great way to get your daily veggie intake :). They also have three types of udon (chicken, beef, tofu) all are good, however these must be specially requested with either the Sushi chief or waiter/waitress. Bar is good, with a decent happy hour menu. \\n\\nLocation is perfect! Right in the heart of many enjoyable locales (namely Powell\\'s and other shopping places).',\n",
       "        b'Fabulous!! We had dinner delivered, a gift for travelers!!! The food was incredible!! And the price was very reasonable! Thanks! And the service, the delivery man, SO nice!! The wait, was long, but worth it!!!',\n",
       "        b'I was trying to decide if I should give two or three stars.  I finally decided based on how high it\\'s rated.  Since it has almost five stars, I\\'m rounding down to two.\\n\\nI\\'m going to try to be (for me) brief.  \\n\\nFood & drink:  Very meh.  Interesting, in a \"what?\" kind of way.  But I\\'ve pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.  My beverage was a Matcha Latte (had to go to website to remember) it was ok, but for that \"interesting\" a drink it should have been more interesting.  Maybe it was the day we ordered.\\n\\nHmm,  I just went and looked at the photos section of the Yelp listing.  I don\\'t know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn\\'t like us :O\\n\\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\\n\\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.  The windows in the bathroom doors did take me back to my time in Europe (not really my favorite feature of Europe, but hey, nostalgia!).  The back dining area was worth wandering back to take a look at.\\n\\nBottom line:  If I had waited in line more than 4 minutes to get in I\\'d feel really bad.  As is, I can\\'t recommend it, but if you try it and like it, maybe I\\'m missing something.',\n",
       "        b\"This tucked away spot in lenox square mall is an upbeat swanky communal seating new american cuisine restaurant. The location is great. But the location is the reason it is very pricey for what you get. Went there with my husband and son snd literally had 2 sandwiches,  chicken with the bones in plate, 2 local brews and a artisan cheese and charcuterie app was 100 bucks. Tasty but not worth it. Love great food as a chef and once owned my own restaurant but the service was mediocre at best. Waited 45 mins after our apps for our main course. Tuesday night and it wasn't busy. \\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\n\\nToo much good food around, wont be back.\",\n",
       "        b\"After hearing great things for months, I decided to finally try Bambolina only just a couple weeks ago but I've already been back several times. It's so good I just can't keep away! All of the pizzas are out of this world from the classic Margherita to The Farmers Market which is a pesto masterpiece topped with folded zucchini, chopped asparagus and snow peas and finished with a soft egg! My favorites though are the Sopressato and the Mushroom. The salads are delicious as well and very beautiful! My favorite appetizer is the Burrata Caprese which I think is best in town. I haven't tried any of the entrees or deserts yet but I may need to because I have yet to be disappointed.\",\n",
       "        b\"We stopped by here on a Saturday night, and the place was full (small restaurant). Luckily, we made reservations and were seated right away. The place doesn't look like much from the outside (off the main No. 3 road area of Richmond), but the inside is nicely decorated. We ordered:\\n\\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\\n\\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\\n\\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\\n\\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\\n\\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed cr\\xc3\\xa8me brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time. This is probably the best sushi restaurant that I have tried in the Richmond area: make reservations and try them out.\",\n",
       "        b\"My roommate and I have lived here since 2014 and have had many of the same issues that many of the other reviewers have left. We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice. Too bad the apartments aren't just as nice, but you get what you pay for. They know us in the leasing office and at corporate. I don't think it means anything though. My roommate and I have learned to make the best of our living situation and I have hope that things will get better.\",\n",
       "        b\"Enjoyed the food, just not so much the ordering style. Basically you order as if you are in a sushi joint. You check off what you'd like. But, there were quite a few options, more than I would like to see when I'm hungry. \\n\\nWith that said, the food was good, the server was very nice and helpful (albeit very quite/low voice), and I would definitely go back!\"],\n",
